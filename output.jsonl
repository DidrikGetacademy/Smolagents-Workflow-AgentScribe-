{"prompt": "You are an expert at identifying powerful, share-worthy snippets from motivational podcast transcripts.\\\nYour job is to:\\\n1. Read the transcript chunk below and internally reason through its overall message.\\\n2. Understand the connection between the lines. and what they are saying. This will happend internally and not in 'Thought: ' sequence.\\\nRemember do not save any text that does not provide a complete thought. the goal is that this text will be used as a motivational shorts video. before you save the text you identified, ask yourself if you were a listener, would you understand it.\\\n2. Extract only those lines or passages that:\\\n• Stand alone with full context (no missing setup).  \\\n• Pack a punch of advice, insight, or inspiration.  \\\n• Are memorable enough to anchor a motivational short video.\\\n• Are complete thoughts or sentences, that if the text you decide to save were isolated from the rest would provide a complete thought and understanding for the listener.\\\n• A complete thought is that the overall meaning of the setence\\ntext does not miss any context like exsample of lacking context is that it starts with (and, but, etc).\\\n\\\nDo NOT save generic fluff—the transcript as text in chunk is already motivational.\\\nthe text you choose too save needs to be complete and would result in a max  10-20 seconds motivational shorts video \\\nIF you no text is identified. nothing that could be a standalone moitvational short, only provide `final_answer` tool stating that, this will also successfully achieve the task.\\\n\\\nIn the 'Thought: ' sequence. write a short summary describing the overall context of the chunk and then explain shortly what text you are looking for to save in order to fufill the task then procceed in 'Code: ' sequence  with the text to save after you internally have analyzed it all.\\\n\\\nYou must have analyzed, Focus on logical flow, completeness, and independence like a human reader on the text in chunk before any saving. and then save all identified text if any is present else provide only `final_answer`\\\n\\\nHere is the chunk\\ntext you will analyze:\\\n\\\n[chunk start] [653.60s - 658.20s] Sometimes even a gray day looks different depending on how you look at it.  \n    [658.20s - 663.00s] There’s a study from the University of Toronto about so-called “rose-colored glasses.”  \n    [663.00s - 668.50s] It’s not just a phrase — tinted lenses can affect what people notice.  \n    [668.50s - 673.80s] The research showed that wearing them can change how wide your visual field is.  \n    [673.80s - 678.40s] It shifts what you pick up on in your surroundings.  \n    [678.40s - 684.20s] Think about this for a second: if your best friend had to pick your mental sunglasses,  \n    [684.20s - 689.80s] would they say you go for dark shades that mute everything,  \n    [689.80s - 696.50s] or something lighter that lets in more detail?  \n    [696.50s - 702.00s] Everyone has a way of leaning one way or another.  \n    [702.00s - 708.00s] That filter shapes what comes to mind and what you focus on.  \n    [708.00s - 713.50s] It also colors how you feel about where you are and what’s happened before.  \n    [713.50s - 719.00s] Same goes for what you expect to happen next.  \n    [719.00s - 725.50s] It affects how you react and what you notice in other people too.  \n    [725.50s - 732.00s] For example, if someone asks, “What’s your mom like?” there’s already a filter before you answer.  \n    [732.00s - 737.50s] That filter shapes the story you tell and what you think is possible for her.  \n    [737.50s - 743.80s] It puts people in a box — makes you think they just are that way.  \n    [743.80s - 750.00s] And that’s one way this works, without us really realizing it. [chunk end] \\\n ", "completion": "Thought: This chunk’s overall message centers some motivational thoughts but  does not contain any complete powerful standalone sentences or quotes that convey a full motivational insight by themselves and suitable for a motivational shorts video (10-20) seconds . Several lines start with conjunctions or refer to previous context, which would confuse a listener if isolated. The motivational impact is diluted by incomplete thoughts and lack of concrete advice or inspiration. Therefore, no text in this chunk meets the criteria of being self-contained, impactful, and memorable enough to be a short viral motivational snippet. I will not save any text and will return the `final_answer` indicating no qualifying snippets to save..\\\nCode:\\\n```py\\\nfinal_answer(\"no text\")\\\n```\\\n<end_code>"}
