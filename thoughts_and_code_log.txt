### Thought:
The chunk discusses the impact of mindset and beliefs on our perception of reality, using the example of a single person's struggle to find a partner. The text is looking for powerful, standalone motivational quotes that can inspire listeners to maintain a positive mindset and take action. The key points to save are those that provide clear, actionable advice or insightful wisdom.

### Code:
```py
text = "[2785.44s - 2790.62s] When day in and day out, all this person can think is, why can't I find somebody? I'll never find somebody. Why does everybody else have somebody? I see all my friends getting approached at the bars. I see my friends getting asked out. Why am I not getting asked out? What you've now learned about the mindset and belief about yourself and the way your filter responds in real time is the more energy you put into a negative narrative like this. It's never going to work out for me. Nobody's ever going to love me. I am unlovable. Everybody else has a date. I'm never going to have a date."
