===INPUT CHUNK START===
[0.00s - 5.70s] Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.
[6.72s - 14.36s] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[14.92s - 16.74s] My guest today is Robert Greene.
[17.42s - 20.84s] Robert Greene is an author who has written more than five best-selling books,
[21.38s - 26.08s] including The 48 Laws of Power, The Laws of Human Nature, and Mastery.
[26.08s - 31.86s] He did his bachelor's training at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Wisconsin at Madison.
[32.52s - 35.80s] Robert Greene's books are both unique and important for several reasons,
[35.86s - 40.56s] not the least of which is that they explore the interaction between the psychology of self,
[41.04s - 47.04s] self-exploration, and the psychology of human interaction, all rooted in history and modern culture,
[47.32s - 50.22s] and at the same time in a way that pertains to everybody.
[50.48s - 53.52s] I first learned about Robert's work from reading the book Mastery,
[53.72s - 60.20s] which, to my mind, is a brilliant exploration and a practical tool for how to think about and pursue one's purpose.
[60.20s - 64.86s] Whenever I'm asked for book suggestions, I always include Mastery in my top three recommendations.
[65.56s - 72.12s] During today's discussion, we cover a wide range of topics, including how to find and pursue and achieve one's purpose.
[72.42s - 77.06s] We talk about the selection of a life partner, as well as romantic and other types of relationships.
[77.46s - 82.44s] We also discuss the topics of motivation and urgency, and this concept of death ground,
[82.54s - 85.56s] which arose during our discussion of Robert's recent stroke.
[85.56s - 91.74s] Robert's stroke rendered him certain limitations, but also has allowed him to explore how to write,
[91.92s - 100.22s] how to exercise, indeed, how to interface with life in general in new ways that allow him to continue to expand his sense of purpose.
[100.58s - 105.26s] I'm certain that by the end of today's episode, you will have gleaned tremendous amounts of new knowledge
[105.26s - 109.24s] that will allow you to navigate forward along the path to your purpose,
[109.24s - 112.00s] perhaps find your purpose, if you feel you haven't done that yet,
[112.32s - 117.84s] as well as to greatly enhance your relationship with yourself, with others, and indeed, to the world around you.
[118.30s - 123.32s] Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[123.86s - 128.62s] It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science
[128.62s - 131.00s] and science-related tools to the general public.
[131.36s - 134.74s] In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[135.22s - 136.82s] Our first sponsor is Roka.
[136.82s - 141.10s] Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are the absolute highest quality.
[141.60s - 144.12s] I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system,
[144.54s - 148.04s] and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges
[148.04s - 149.96s] in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[150.56s - 154.56s] Roka understands those challenges and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly
[154.56s - 157.04s] so that you always see with crystal clarity.
[157.42s - 161.26s] Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed with a new technology called FloatFit,
[161.64s - 165.40s] which allows them to fit perfectly and not move around even when you're active.
[165.40s - 169.82s] In fact, whenever I'm wearing my Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses, I usually forget that I'm wearing them.
[170.20s - 173.82s] I happen to wear Roka eyeglasses at night when I drive or if I'm reading at night,
[174.16s - 178.92s] and I wear Roka sunglasses during the daytime if it's very bright, especially if I'm driving into sunlight.
[179.14s - 182.98s] If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses, you can go to Roka.com,
[182.98s - 188.28s] and that's R-O-K-A dot com, and enter the code Huberman for 20% off your first order.
[188.40s - 192.46s] Again, that's R-O-K-A dot com, and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[192.90s - 195.40s] Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[195.90s - 200.18s] Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are tailored to your unique sleep needs.
[200.90s - 204.04s] Now, sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[204.56s - 208.18s] When we are sleeping well and enough, mental health, physical health, and performance
[208.18s - 210.00s] all stand to be at their best.
[210.24s - 213.18s] One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress
[213.18s - 215.60s] is tailored to your unique sleep needs.

===REASONING STEPS===
Thought:
The chunk provided is a transcript of a podcast interview with Andrew Huberman and Robert Greene. The overall context of the chunk is an introduction to the podcast and a discussion about Robert Greene's books and his insights on purpose, relationships, and motivation. The task is to extract motivational text that can stand alone as a short motivational video.

In this context, I am looking for:
- Complete, standalone motivational quotes or messages.
- Text that is inspiring, uplifting, and actionable.
- Text that is memorable and can be easily understood by the listener.

After analyzing the chunk, I found a powerful quote that fits these criteria. It is a complete thought and can be used as a motivational short video.

[0.00s - 3.28s] Whatever rules you decide are true, become true for you.
[3.52s - 4.52s] If you think about human history,
[4.64s - 7.56s] we've been slaving away for the longest time.
[7.82s - 9.84s] What's about to happen in 2025
[9.84s - 12.84s] is that the definition of success is changing.
[13.02s - 14.90s] This is the perfect time for us
[14.90s - 17.08s] to fully, fully embrace what we love.
[17.22s - 18.78s] What we should be teaching adults to do
[18.78s - 20.04s] is to answer eight questions.
[20.28s - 21.48s] Answer these eight questions,
[21.84s - 23.86s] and I think you'll be setting your life up
[23.86s - 27.48s] for a lot of beauty, elegance, happiness, and success.
[27.48s - 29.56s] And what people don't even know
[29.56s - 33.56s] is this, stop trying to glorify hustle culture.
[33.66s - 35.60s] Hustle culture is a thing of the past.
[35.90s - 37.52s] This is what I'm trying to wake people up to.
[38.06s - 39.62s] We have two great spiritual needs,
[39.80s - 41.52s] the need to grow and the need to contribute.
[41.94s - 43.14s] And you have that purpose.
[43.34s - 45.24s] You have more fuel, you have more energy,
[45.38s - 46.94s] you have more excitement about life,
[47.00s - 47.92s] you feel more fulfilled.
[48.04s - 49.56s] But if everyone was doing that,
[49.72s - 51.88s] imagine how beautiful the world would be.
[57.51s - 60.21s] Hey everyone, welcome back to the Know Thyself Podcast.
[60.57s - 63.31s] Our guest today is a best-selling author,
[63.31s - 65.29s] founder, and CEO of Mindvalley,
[65.47s - 68.11s] which is a global education company
[68.11s - 71.15s] that is transforming the way we think about self-help,
[71.27s - 72.69s] personal development, well-being.
[73.19s - 75.37s] And it's been a pleasure to develop our friendship
[75.37s - 76.33s] over the past couple of years
[76.33s - 78.95s] and see the inspiring work he's really stewarding
[78.95s - 81.59s] and pioneering in the space of helping people
[81.59s - 83.13s] come back home to themselves
[83.13s - 85.91s] and become powerful creators in the world.
[86.15s - 87.71s] Vishen Lakhiani, thank you for being here.
[87.77s - 88.39s] Thank you, Andre.
[88.39s - 90.55s] By the way, this is an amazing set.
[91.89s - 93.43s] Thank you, I appreciate it.
[93.43s - 94.19s] It's just so soothing.
[94.95s - 96.11s] It's so peaceful.
[96.35s - 98.23s] I've never been in a podcast set like that.
[98.59s - 102.35s] It feels like you're in a spa, not a studio.
[102.59s - 105.73s] Yeah, I try to make these conversations,
[106.11s - 107.53s] like the atmosphere feel a little bit more
[107.53s - 110.55s] like a ceremony than just casual.
[111.55s - 112.81s] And so I'm glad it's cozy.
[113.09s - 114.39s] Also, this tea is amazing.
[114.59s - 114.81s] Yeah.
[114.89s - 116.13s] I don't even know what you put in here.
[116.81s - 117.65s] It's the stuff from Peak.
[117.77s - 118.35s] They're a sponsor.
[118.55s - 119.93s] So I'm glad you like it.
[120.07s - 120.39s] Amazing.
[121.21s - 124.29s] Man, there are so many amazing avenues
[124.29s - 125.77s] I'm excited to explore with you.
[125.77s - 130.31s] I really love individuals that are playing at a big scale
[130.31s - 132.67s] that are very aligned with a message
[132.67s - 134.47s] and vehicle of service to the planet.
[135.43s - 137.41s] I'm sure it's evolved over the years for you,
[137.49s - 139.91s] but how do you currently, as of today,
[140.15s - 142.27s] define what success means to you?
[142.27s - 146.39s] So the definition of success is changing
[146.39s - 150.57s] only because we, in 2025, literally this year,
[150.77s - 152.97s] we're entering a new era of humanity.
[153.37s - 158.31s] And that is the era of human beings working with AI
[158.31s - 162.53s] to not just transform the world, build companies,
[163.07s - 165.05s] but to make work dematerialize.
[165.79s - 167.47s] So if you think about human history, right,
[168.53s - 171.79s] we've been slaving away for the longest time,
[171.79s - 175.79s] ever since we moved from being hunter-gatherers to farmers.
[176.45s - 177.67s] Now, the hunter-gatherer lifestyle
[177.67s - 179.45s] was actually a superior lifestyle.
[180.23s - 183.53s] I mean, day one, you're hiking through a forest,
[183.75s - 184.55s] hunting animals.
[184.55s - 187.23s] You'd probably be done with your work in two or three hours,
[187.59s - 188.35s] have enough to eat,
[188.71s - 189.91s] and then spend the rest of your time
[189.91s - 191.13s] with nature, with family.
[191.13s - 194.03s] But when we moved to farming and growing crops,
[194.23s - 195.41s] life got really hard.
[195.53s - 197.21s] All historians agree on this fact.
[198.60s - 201.30s] And what happened is working hours started increasing
[201.30s - 202.90s] and increasing and increasing
[202.90s - 204.64s] because first you're managing the crops,
[205.12s - 205.70s] then you are,
[205.94s - 207.10s] or if you're not managing the crops,

[406.60s - 409.16s] and honoring and discovering
[409.16s - 410.62s] what that unique seed is
[410.62s - 411.86s] that you want to contribute to the world,
[412.04s - 413.20s] how would you describe that?
[413.42s - 415.84s] So I'm actually working on an idea right now.
[415.96s - 417.78s] I call it Soul Pact.
[418.34s - 419.20s] And it happened because
[419.20s - 421.54s] I was looking at how I was building my company
[421.54s - 424.42s] and I realized all the old rules no longer apply.
[424.98s - 426.14s] And what I want,
[426.30s - 427.32s] what I thought I wanted,
[427.70s - 429.47s] no longer matters to me.
[429.93s - 431.73s] And at first, for about six months,
[431.75s - 434.81s] I got really jaded, almost sad.
[434.81s - 438.75s] So I used to love employing lots of people.
[439.43s - 440.91s] You know, at our peak, we were 400 people.
[441.19s - 443.13s] I loved designer offices.
[443.37s - 445.27s] My office twice made it to Inc. Magazine,
[445.53s - 446.87s] most beautiful offices in the world.
[447.25s - 448.27s] And then all of a sudden,
[448.37s - 449.81s] the world started changing post-COVID.
[450.33s - 451.09s] And I realized,
[451.59s - 452.99s] I don't want to work from an office.
[453.49s - 454.35s] I want to work from home.
[455.01s - 456.99s] I want to be able to travel with my kids
[456.99s - 459.69s] and really get to know my children
[459.69s - 461.03s] before they leave for university.
[461.03s - 462.69s] Still getting to work.
[463.27s - 465.21s] But last week, for example,
[465.21s - 467.17s] I was with my son and daughter in South Korea.
[467.55s - 468.93s] The week before that, we were in Malaysia.
[469.11s - 469.81s] The week before that,
[469.87s - 472.25s] we were attending classes in Singularity University.
[472.83s - 473.97s] I like that freedom.
[475.24s - 477.42s] Money has stopped mattering to me.
[477.80s - 480.82s] As long as I have a home that I love being in,
[481.38s - 483.62s] the things that most matter are human connection.
[484.32s - 486.70s] And what has become insanely important
[486.70s - 488.78s] is health and free time.
[488.78s - 493.04s] And so I've started re-evaluating all my goals.
[493.14s - 495.72s] And Andre, man, it's been crazy
[495.72s - 496.70s] because for the longest time,
[496.78s - 498.30s] I was working towards building a company
[498.30s - 499.70s] with a valuation of a billion dollars.
[499.78s - 500.16s] At its peak,
[500.56s - 502.78s] we were just under a billion in valuation.
[503.72s - 504.80s] And now,
[504.98s - 506.76s] I just don't know if that matters anymore.
[507.16s - 508.56s] I still want to build something great,
[508.76s - 511.46s] but I want to build it with tiny teams,
[512.54s - 513.62s] complete flexibility,
[514.20s - 515.38s] few hours a day,
[515.38s - 521.06s] and with tons of like AI agents supporting us.
[522.34s - 523.20s] I love it, man.
[523.26s - 524.60s] I think to a degree,
[524.60s - 527.02s] there are these games that we play in life
[527.02s - 528.62s] that we almost need to play out
[528.62s - 529.90s] in order to go beyond them.
[530.60s - 530.78s] You know,
[530.86s - 533.04s] so money obviously being a big one of that,
[533.16s - 533.42s] you know,
[533.46s - 536.16s] for the entrepreneurial spirit in many of us,
[536.16s - 537.48s] it's building a big organization
[537.48s - 538.34s] or building a team
[538.34s - 540.60s] to almost prove something to ourself in a sense.
[541.45s - 543.39s] But then you get back to the core of,
[543.55s - 543.63s] okay,
[543.83s - 545.75s] how do I really want to live?
[546.25s - 549.11s] And what is going to be the most impactful thing
[549.11s - 550.63s] that I can do with my time for the planet?
[550.85s - 552.89s] And as somebody who's spending so much time
[552.89s - 554.29s] thinking about education
[554.29s - 556.91s] from a new paradigm perspective
[556.91s - 559.75s] and trying to bring more unity on the planet
[559.75s - 561.59s] and democratize it in such a big way,
[561.95s - 563.11s] what comes up for you
[563.11s - 564.29s] in this new chapter of your life?
[564.29s - 566.51s] So I was writing down my goals recently, right?
[566.65s - 568.29s] And this thought occurred to me.
[568.71s - 568.99s] School.
[569.63s - 570.59s] School prepared us.
[570.89s - 573.07s] According to Calvin Coolidge in the 1920s,
[574.00s - 574.84s] the point of education
[574.84s - 578.38s] is to create cogs in the wheels of industry.
[580.16s - 581.68s] That doesn't sound like a really healthy way
[581.68s - 583.06s] of like raising human beings, right?
[583.52s - 585.32s] But we've been doing that for a really long time.
[586.12s - 587.90s] I think that whole system
[587.90s - 590.00s] is now ripe for disruption.
[591.40s - 594.00s] I think what we should be teaching adults to do
[594.00s - 595.52s] is to answer eight questions.
[596.22s - 597.76s] Now, to make it easy to understand,
[597.96s - 599.96s] I'd like to share these questions with your audience

[821.74s - 822.44s] Saturday, Sunday,
[822.74s - 823.42s] Monday in London,
[823.58s - 824.66s] fly out Monday night,
[824.66s - 826.00s] be back in Dubai
[826.00s - 827.70s] to go to run my company
[827.70s - 828.32s] by Tuesday.
[830.38s - 830.94s] Opportunity.
[832.12s - 833.28s] Success and wealth
[833.28s - 834.78s] comes from creating space
[834.78s - 835.88s] for opportunity.
[836.64s - 839.64s] Giving yourself thresholds
[839.64s - 840.24s] like capacity
[840.24s - 841.18s] of what you want to allocate
[841.18s - 841.92s] to a project,
[842.14s - 843.44s] not letting that project
[843.44s - 845.24s] expand and free up your time,
[845.82s - 848.38s] but giving yourself opportunity
[848.38s - 850.30s] where you can discover the world,
[850.42s - 851.42s] where you can see
[851.42s - 852.90s] beautiful new things.
[852.96s - 853.60s] Remember that trip
[853.60s - 854.32s] we did on Egypt,
[854.68s - 854.98s] right?
[855.82s - 856.78s] That was amazing, right?
[856.88s - 857.66s] Like we spent, what,
[857.76s - 858.92s] seven, eight days in Egypt,
[859.34s - 860.22s] but all of us could do it
[860.22s - 861.72s] because in our lives
[861.72s - 862.60s] we had created space
[862.60s - 863.34s] for opportunity.
[864.10s - 865.46s] And I think bringing this
[865.46s - 867.16s] a little bit to the micro level too,
[867.40s - 868.88s] there's space for opportunity
[868.88s - 870.26s] within our life,
[870.58s - 872.36s] years, month, week,
[872.42s - 873.06s] and also day.
[873.16s - 874.12s] We can create spaces
[874.12s - 876.02s] in pockets of these day
[876.02s - 878.00s] where we kind of set aside
[878.00s - 879.84s] all of the woes
[879.84s - 881.38s] and all of the knowns
[881.38s - 882.04s] in our life
[882.04s - 883.40s] and create space
[883.40s - 884.92s] for things to arise
[884.92s - 886.78s] that are perhaps greater
[886.78s - 887.98s] than we could conceive of,
[888.10s - 888.36s] you know?
[888.40s - 889.46s] And so I like that idea
[889.46s - 890.18s] of creating space
[890.18s - 890.78s] for opportunity
[890.78s - 891.98s] both at the macro scale
[891.98s - 893.00s] in terms of our calendar
[893.00s - 893.56s] and our life,
[893.60s - 894.20s] but then also
[894.20s - 897.00s] within our daily moments too.
[897.28s - 898.52s] So the goal
[898.52s - 899.32s] that you want to write down
[899.32s - 900.46s] is I create space
[900.46s - 902.04s] for opportunity by,
[902.62s - 903.36s] and then it could be
[903.36s - 904.58s] keeping Fridays free
[904.58s - 906.14s] or keeping
[906.14s - 907.32s] or stopping work
[907.32s - 908.70s] after 5 p.m.
[909.06s - 909.78s] so I can focus
[909.78s - 910.72s] on learning and growth.
[910.72s - 911.80s] Amazing.
[912.04s - 912.24s] Okay.
[912.48s - 913.20s] So what's the U?
[913.44s - 914.76s] The U is unique edge.
[915.46s - 915.92s] Unique edge.
[915.92s - 916.76s] The question there is,
[917.54s - 918.84s] I am known
[918.84s - 920.24s] in the world
[920.24s - 920.92s] for,
[922.70s - 924.16s] describe that.
[924.64s - 925.78s] So in a world of AI,
[926.26s - 926.96s] generative AI
[926.96s - 928.40s] can create,
[928.54s - 928.66s] you know,
[928.78s - 929.34s] there's that scene
[929.34s - 931.42s] from that Will Smith movie,
[931.66s - 932.06s] I, Robot.
[932.74s - 933.38s] And at this point,
[933.46s - 934.26s] Will is pissed off
[934.26s - 934.76s] at the robots
[934.76s - 935.26s] and he says,
[935.34s - 936.10s] you know something?
[936.72s - 937.86s] You will never create art.
[938.10s - 939.30s] You will never create poetry.
[939.30s - 940.54s] You will never know
[940.54s - 941.20s] what it's like
[941.20s - 943.92s] to write something human.
[944.60s - 945.36s] Well, Will was wrong.
[945.62s - 946.52s] AI is creating art.
[946.88s - 947.76s] AI is creating poetry.
[948.18s - 949.38s] AI is creating music.
[950.06s - 951.14s] We got that wrong.
[951.76s - 952.88s] So what makes us human?
[955.83s - 957.29s] What we need to do
[957.29s - 958.27s] is hone in
[958.27s - 959.21s] on that unique edge.
[959.61s - 960.51s] Maybe that unique edge
[960.51s - 961.15s] is you're
[961.15s - 962.99s] an incredible interviewer
[962.99s - 964.51s] with a spiritual soul.

===INPUT CHUNK START===
[964.93s - 965.47s] You know how to make
[965.47s - 966.13s] your guests comfortable.
[966.25s - 967.03s] You know how to extract
[967.03s - 967.83s] wisdom from that.
[968.25s - 968.67s] That's harder
[968.67s - 969.47s] for an AI to do.
[970.05s - 970.41s] Typically,
[970.91s - 971.85s] to find your unique edge,
[971.89s - 972.33s] you've got to find
[972.33s - 973.55s] one or two or three things
[973.55s - 974.47s] that you can be
[974.47s - 975.31s] really good at
[975.31s - 976.95s] and then combine them.
[977.61s - 978.41s] So I combine.
[978.91s - 980.27s] I studied computer engineering,
[980.39s - 981.33s] so I combine that
[981.33s - 984.01s] with spiritual teaching
[984.01s - 985.07s] because I became
[985.07s - 985.95s] a meditation teacher.
[986.47s - 987.73s] And then I combine that
[987.73s - 990.65s] with my stage presence
[990.65s - 991.19s] because I studied
[991.19s - 991.77s] to be an actor.
[992.23s - 993.27s] So that's my unique edge.
[993.33s - 994.45s] I combine three things.
[995.51s - 996.61s] You can't have a unique edge
[996.61s - 997.73s] if you just have one thing.
[998.23s - 999.23s] You've got to combine them.
[999.69s - 1000.93s] And if you can combine them
[1000.93s - 1002.07s] in the right way,
[1002.79s - 1003.81s] that could be a recipe
[1003.81s - 1004.99s] for something
[1004.99s - 1005.77s] really beautiful.
[1006.79s - 1008.95s] What is your unique edge?
[1009.07s - 1010.11s] What are you going
[1010.11s - 1011.13s] to be known for?
[1012.49s - 1013.31s] There's a couple things
[1013.31s - 1015.07s] that ring a bell for me
[1015.07s - 1016.35s] when you talk about this.
[1016.53s - 1016.97s] First,
[1017.25s - 1020.11s] the unique distinct differences
[1020.11s - 1021.23s] between obviously
[1021.23s - 1022.47s] humanoid robots
[1022.47s - 1024.59s] who are bereft
[1024.59s - 1025.79s] of an internal
[1025.79s - 1027.11s] qualia experience,
[1027.23s - 1027.47s] you know,
[1027.51s - 1027.85s] of life
[1027.85s - 1028.61s] and having consciousness
[1028.61s - 1029.27s] in that way.
[1029.97s - 1030.59s] And then two,
[1030.83s - 1031.63s] how we're going
[1031.63s - 1032.31s] to change
[1032.31s - 1033.01s] how we relate
[1033.01s - 1034.39s] to what makes us unique
[1034.39s - 1035.13s] in terms of human
[1035.13s - 1036.69s] because societally
[1036.69s - 1037.83s] for the past few hundred years
[1037.83s - 1039.19s] we've really pedestalized
[1039.19s - 1039.85s] the intellect
[1039.85s - 1040.57s] as sort of
[1040.57s - 1041.61s] the chief
[1041.61s - 1043.99s] most impressive thing
[1043.99s - 1045.53s] about us humans, right?
[1045.63s - 1047.11s] And we're having
[1047.11s - 1047.93s] a paradigm shift
[1047.93s - 1049.05s] of what is intelligence
[1049.05s - 1050.41s] and the democratization
[1050.41s - 1050.85s] of that
[1050.85s - 1051.87s] in this current moment.
[1052.37s - 1053.19s] But when you talk
[1053.19s - 1054.23s] about unique edge,
[1054.85s - 1055.57s] and I think of everybody
[1055.57s - 1056.51s] who's listening right now,
[1056.51s - 1057.89s] all of us want to discover
[1057.89s - 1058.69s] and reveal
[1058.69s - 1060.63s] what is our unique expression
[1060.63s - 1061.15s] in life,
[1061.25s - 1062.55s] both in terms of
[1062.55s - 1064.21s] our creative arts,
[1064.43s - 1065.35s] our businesses,
[1065.63s - 1066.19s] our families
[1066.19s - 1067.01s] and the world
[1067.01s - 1068.81s] and we're all unique humans.
[1068.99s - 1069.95s] All life and nature
[1069.95s - 1071.61s] is a unique expression, right?
[1071.73s - 1073.57s] And I've enjoyed seeing
[1073.57s - 1075.25s] content and conversations
[1075.25s - 1076.43s] of yours over the years
[1076.43s - 1077.75s] talking about this distinction
[1077.75s - 1079.49s] between authentic desires
[1079.49s - 1080.65s] and goals
[1080.65s - 1082.69s] which are culturally conditioned,
[1082.99s - 1083.17s] you know,
[1083.23s - 1083.99s] like for example,
[1084.13s - 1084.57s] our notions
[1084.57s - 1085.63s] of what success means.
[1086.21s - 1087.17s] And so when you think
[1087.17s - 1087.91s] about that distinction,
[1088.15s - 1089.19s] if we want to unlock
[1089.19s - 1089.75s] and reveal
[1089.75s - 1090.83s] our unique expression,
[1091.33s - 1092.43s] how do you distill down
[1092.43s - 1093.89s] what your authentic desires are
[1093.89s - 1094.67s] as that's the kind of
[1094.67s - 1096.13s] revealing process for that?
[1096.75s - 1098.49s] So this brings us
[1098.49s - 1099.41s] to the fourth one, right?
[1099.47s - 1100.15s] Which is L.
[1100.35s - 1101.77s] And L simply stands for love.
[1102.41s - 1103.35s] So what is it
[1103.35s - 1105.55s] that you enjoy doing?
[1106.01s - 1106.99s] Even if you
[1106.99s - 1108.49s] don't get any likes,
[1109.01s - 1109.87s] you can share it
[1109.87s - 1110.73s] on your Pinterest board
[1110.73s - 1112.28s] and you aren't going
[1112.28s - 1112.98s] to get paid for it.
[1112.98s - 1116.06s] So love,
[1116.26s - 1116.92s] part of that

===INPUT CHUNK START===
[1116.92s - 1117.98s] can be a unique edge.
[1118.00s - 1118.76s] So let me give you an example.
[1119.28s - 1119.86s] When I was young,
[1119.88s - 1121.16s] I was deep into martial arts.
[1121.36s - 1122.28s] Like I got all the way
[1122.28s - 1124.28s] to a second degree
[1124.28s - 1125.62s] black belt in taekwondo.
[1126.69s - 1129.29s] And I was so into martial arts
[1129.29s - 1130.11s] that I would have to
[1130.11s - 1131.31s] take time off from school
[1131.31s - 1133.15s] to compete in competitions.
[1133.95s - 1134.57s] And I remember
[1134.57s - 1135.73s] a teacher told me,
[1135.95s - 1136.77s] why are you doing this?
[1137.09s - 1138.23s] You're never going to make money
[1138.23s - 1139.09s] in martial arts.
[1139.65s - 1140.35s] What's the point?
[1140.87s - 1141.77s] My dream at that time
[1141.77s - 1142.61s] was to open a dojo.
[1142.61s - 1143.69s] So maybe I'd watch
[1143.69s - 1144.45s] like one too many
[1144.45s - 1145.35s] karate kid movies.
[1145.55s - 1146.49s] I want to be like
[1146.49s - 1147.53s] the Malaysian Miyagi.
[1148.43s - 1149.25s] And for a while,
[1149.29s - 1150.21s] I believed that school teacher.
[1150.85s - 1151.47s] But that school teacher
[1151.47s - 1151.99s] was wrong.
[1152.77s - 1155.66s] So I followed martial arts
[1155.66s - 1156.56s] because of love.
[1156.96s - 1157.98s] I got to a level
[1157.98s - 1159.16s] where I got in,
[1159.36s - 1160.22s] I got to compete
[1160.22s - 1161.14s] and represent my country,
[1161.28s - 1161.54s] Malaysia,
[1161.74s - 1162.54s] in the US Open.
[1163.02s - 1163.86s] That was my first time
[1163.86s - 1164.78s] setting foot in America.
[1165.36s - 1166.38s] My God, Andre,
[1166.50s - 1167.26s] I fell in love
[1167.26s - 1167.96s] with this country.
[1168.62s - 1169.12s] And so although
[1169.12s - 1169.94s] I went to a British school
[1169.94s - 1170.38s] and I was supposed
[1170.38s - 1171.24s] to go to university
[1171.24s - 1171.78s] in the UK,
[1172.32s - 1173.32s] I decided to divert.
[1174.00s - 1174.98s] I lost a year,
[1175.12s - 1175.80s] but I decided to go
[1175.80s - 1177.30s] and study in the United States.
[1177.82s - 1178.30s] Now, of course,
[1178.34s - 1178.96s] I had no idea
[1178.96s - 1179.86s] about American geography,
[1179.86s - 1181.60s] so I stupidly picked Michigan,
[1182.36s - 1183.32s] the coldest,
[1183.40s - 1185.14s] one of the coldest states possible,
[1185.28s - 1186.46s] minus 40 with windchill
[1186.46s - 1186.86s] in the winter.
[1186.98s - 1187.64s] I grew up in Michigan.
[1187.90s - 1188.18s] You did?
[1188.24s - 1188.62s] I know.
[1188.62s - 1189.62s] I know the winters are brutal.
[1189.62s - 1192.48s] And while I was there,
[1193.22s - 1193.82s] I never forgot
[1193.82s - 1195.24s] my martial arts.
[1195.24s - 1196.28s] I couldn't find
[1196.28s - 1198.00s] any good martial arts schools,
[1198.08s - 1198.52s] but I started
[1198.52s - 1199.60s] studying meditation.
[1200.20s - 1200.66s] And eventually,
[1200.96s - 1202.62s] I started teaching meditation.
[1203.12s - 1204.10s] Meditation and martial arts
[1204.10s - 1204.92s] are very,
[1205.08s - 1205.42s] very,
[1205.54s - 1206.36s] very related,
[1206.92s - 1207.18s] right?
[1207.24s - 1208.18s] You've heard of the concept
[1208.18s - 1209.08s] of Kung Fu monks.
[1209.20s - 1211.22s] They are supremely related.
[1211.32s - 1211.72s] They both come
[1211.72s - 1212.64s] from Eastern cultures.
[1212.80s - 1214.02s] They overlap a lot.
[1214.86s - 1215.56s] And look,
[1215.62s - 1216.38s] I took meditation
[1216.38s - 1217.20s] and I built
[1217.20s - 1218.12s] an app
[1218.12s - 1219.43s] that did
[1219.43s - 1220.21s] over 100 million
[1220.21s - 1220.75s] a year
[1220.75s - 1221.69s] in meditation.
[1221.85s - 1222.27s] So my teacher
[1222.27s - 1222.77s] was wrong.
[1223.84s - 1224.66s] What I did was
[1224.66s - 1226.30s] I followed my love.
[1226.52s - 1226.74s] Now,
[1226.78s - 1227.66s] it didn't happen
[1227.66s - 1228.20s] overnight.
[1228.32s - 1229.34s] It took maybe
[1229.34s - 1230.56s] 20 years,
[1231.10s - 1233.02s] but I never did it
[1233.02s - 1233.46s] for the money.
[1234.10s - 1234.98s] If I hadn't followed
[1234.98s - 1235.72s] my love,
[1236.54s - 1237.38s] and love can lead you
[1237.38s - 1238.50s] in really interesting ways,
[1238.84s - 1239.48s] I probably wouldn't
[1239.48s - 1240.32s] be sitting here today.
[1240.56s - 1241.28s] I probably wouldn't
[1241.28s - 1241.92s] be on stage
[1241.92s - 1242.60s] a week from now
[1242.60s - 1243.00s] in LA
[1243.00s - 1244.64s] interviewing Gwyneth Paltrow
[1244.64s - 1246.04s] on stage with Joe Dispenza
[1246.04s - 1247.90s] speaking about meditation.
[1249.06s - 1249.90s] I ignored
[1249.90s - 1250.68s] the advice
[1250.68s - 1251.26s] from my teacher
[1251.26s - 1252.24s] who was trying
[1252.24s - 1253.16s] to train me
[1253.16s - 1253.72s] for money.
[1254.22s - 1255.02s] Remember his words,
[1255.08s - 1255.78s] there's no money

[1399.38s - 1400.62s] Bullshit Rules, right?
[1400.66s - 1401.88s] We develop bullshit rules
[1401.88s - 1403.58s] about the world around us.
[1404.08s - 1404.40s] And, you know,
[1404.70s - 1405.32s] one of my mentors
[1405.32s - 1406.00s] is Bob Proctor.
[1406.22s - 1408.08s] Bob was a dear friend
[1408.08s - 1409.54s] and very sad
[1409.54s - 1410.58s] that he died in 2022.
[1411.58s - 1412.78s] And he created
[1412.78s - 1413.32s] a meditation
[1413.32s - 1414.96s] that he dedicated to me.
[1415.04s - 1415.24s] It's called
[1415.24s - 1416.20s] The Abundance Meditation.
[1416.32s - 1416.84s] It's on YouTube.
[1416.96s - 1417.44s] Go listen to it.
[1417.46s - 1417.88s] It's amazing.
[1418.90s - 1419.58s] And one of the things
[1419.58s - 1420.64s] he says in that meditation,
[1420.90s - 1421.78s] and it's in my mind
[1421.78s - 1422.50s] because I was listening
[1422.50s - 1424.02s] to it this morning,
[1424.08s - 1424.58s] is he says,
[1424.72s - 1426.10s] the greatest illusion
[1426.10s - 1427.20s] we have as human beings
[1427.20s - 1428.46s] is that
[1428.46s - 1430.32s] there is anything
[1430.32s - 1431.24s] in reality
[1431.24s - 1433.28s] that is outside
[1433.28s - 1433.86s] our control.
[1435.05s - 1436.31s] So what he's saying is
[1436.31s - 1436.93s] literally
[1436.93s - 1438.73s] all of reality
[1438.73s - 1440.15s] is within our control.
[1440.15s - 1442.27s] Now, it's within
[1442.27s - 1443.69s] such a degree of control
[1443.69s - 1445.25s] that whatever rules
[1445.25s - 1446.11s] you've decided
[1446.11s - 1448.21s] work, okay?
[1448.29s - 1449.25s] Outside the rules of physics
[1449.25s - 1450.07s] and the rules of law.
[1450.57s - 1451.71s] Let's not try to bend those.
[1452.05s - 1452.89s] But whatever rules
[1452.89s - 1454.07s] you decide are true
[1454.07s - 1455.51s] become true for you.
[1456.23s - 1457.29s] That is why
[1457.29s - 1458.97s] being able to identify
[1458.97s - 1460.83s] any truth
[1460.83s - 1461.69s] that you see in the world,
[1461.75s - 1462.51s] being able to identify,
[1462.67s - 1463.83s] is this actually true?
[1464.03s - 1464.89s] Or is this what
[1464.89s - 1465.75s] my mom, my dad,
[1465.83s - 1466.49s] my school teacher,
[1467.01s - 1467.31s] media,
[1467.47s - 1468.27s] my political party,
[1468.37s - 1468.77s] my culture,
[1468.85s - 1469.15s] my race,
[1469.15s - 1470.37s] my religion told me is true?
[1470.79s - 1472.49s] Because it will be true for you.
[1473.07s - 1474.33s] There's a lot of medical science
[1474.33s - 1475.01s] for this as well.
[1475.75s - 1476.87s] Whatever you believe to be true
[1476.87s - 1478.71s] will be true for you.
[1479.03s - 1479.85s] In medical science,
[1479.89s - 1480.95s] it's called a placebo effect.
[1481.05s - 1481.93s] If you believe
[1481.93s - 1484.87s] you take a pill
[1484.87s - 1485.87s] that isn't really a pill,
[1486.77s - 1488.23s] you can heal an illness.
[1488.81s - 1489.65s] They're now seeing
[1489.65s - 1490.57s] the placebo effect
[1490.57s - 1492.25s] expand to surgery.
[1492.39s - 1493.07s] Since 2013,
[1493.07s - 1494.07s] it was proven that
[1494.07s - 1495.89s] fake surgery
[1495.89s - 1496.85s] can heal a patient.
[1497.23s - 1497.97s] As long as the patient
[1497.97s - 1498.93s] believed that the surgery
[1498.93s - 1499.33s] happened
[1499.33s - 1500.33s] because the patient
[1500.33s - 1501.63s] was put under anesthesia
[1501.63s - 1502.53s] and could see some cuts
[1502.53s - 1503.43s] on their body.
[1504.09s - 1504.35s] And so,
[1505.15s - 1506.09s] our mind
[1506.09s - 1507.79s] is a meaning-making machine.
[1508.57s - 1509.11s] And as children,
[1509.33s - 1510.21s] we take meaning
[1510.21s - 1510.77s] from the world.
[1511.13s - 1511.87s] These meanings become
[1511.87s - 1513.23s] a scaffolding of rules
[1513.23s - 1514.15s] and then we operate
[1514.15s - 1514.93s] between these rules.
[1515.23s - 1516.43s] The most harmful rules
[1516.43s - 1517.45s] are rules such as,
[1517.83s - 1518.45s] I'm not worthy,
[1518.91s - 1519.53s] I'm stupid,
[1520.11s - 1520.81s] I'm unlovable,
[1521.43s - 1522.15s] I'm damaged,
[1522.53s - 1523.31s] I'm not attractive.
[1523.91s - 1524.39s] And by the way,
[1524.57s - 1525.99s] I've had all of those rules
[1525.99s - 1527.29s] growing up as a teenager.
[1527.29s - 1529.45s] But once you can identify
[1529.45s - 1531.29s] what is absolute truth
[1531.29s - 1533.03s] and what is
[1533.03s - 1534.85s] a societal opinion,
[1535.72s - 1536.86s] you get to break free
[1536.86s - 1537.66s] from these shackles,
[1537.74s - 1539.28s] from this artificial scaffolding.
[1539.58s - 1540.90s] And that's when you really
[1540.90s - 1541.86s] get to understand
[1541.86s - 1543.40s] the power of what Bob said.
[1544.38s - 1546.38s] Everything in reality
[1546.38s - 1548.60s] is created
[1548.60s - 1550.14s] by your mind.
[1550.14s - 1553.20s] I like that
[1553.20s - 1554.22s] and that we are
[1554.22s - 1555.50s] a co-creator with reality
===INPUT CHUNK END===

===REASONING STEPS===
Thought:
The chunk discusses the concept of "bullshit rules" and the power of the mind in shaping reality. The speaker mentions Bob Proctor and his meditation on abundance, emphasizing that our beliefs and perceptions influence our reality. The text is rich in motivational content, but we need to identify a complete, standalone thought that can be used as a motivational short.

[1555.50s - 1556.34s] and we have influence
[1556.34s - 1557.08s] over reality.
[1557.54s - 1558.46s] And I love Bob too.
[1558.54s - 1559.34s] I started with him
[1559.34s - 1560.58s] earlier on in my journey
[1560.58s - 1562.90s] and I don't love
[1562.90s - 1563.48s] the verbiage
[1563.48s - 1564.68s] everything within reality
[1564.68s - 1566.02s] if he articulated it this way
[1566.02s - 1567.12s] is within our control.
[1567.48s - 1568.78s] That word to me
[1568.78s - 1571.40s] sort of denotes
[1571.40s - 1572.52s] like dominion
[1572.52s - 1574.36s] over reality
[1574.36s - 1575.02s] in a way
[1575.02s - 1575.88s] which I think
[1575.88s - 1576.80s] can set people up
[1576.80s - 1577.52s] in an unrealistic
[1577.52s - 1579.12s] kind of fashion.
[1579.72s - 1580.40s] What do you think
[1580.40s - 1580.86s] about there
[1580.86s - 1582.04s] and do you think
[1582.04s - 1582.72s] there's a better word
[1582.72s - 1583.42s] that could be replaced
[1583.42s - 1583.88s] with control?
[1583.92s - 1584.20s] Well again,
[1584.30s - 1585.30s] I'm paraphrasing, right?
[1585.54s - 1586.34s] I heard him say
[1586.34s - 1587.44s] this meditation this morning.
[1587.82s - 1588.72s] I think if you listen
[1588.72s - 1590.12s] to his full abundance meditation
[1590.12s - 1591.68s] he describes it
[1591.68s - 1592.08s] but I think
[1592.08s - 1593.08s] what he's really saying
[1593.08s - 1593.44s] is that
[1593.44s - 1594.58s] it is a delusion
[1594.58s - 1595.52s] that you don't have control
[1595.52s - 1596.28s] over your reality.
[1596.42s - 1596.96s] We all do.
[1597.66s - 1598.68s] That's what he's saying.
[1599.82s - 1600.00s] Yeah,
[1600.10s - 1600.82s] and the realization
[1600.82s - 1601.58s] that our thoughts
[1601.58s - 1602.64s] do influence reality
[1602.64s - 1603.42s] in ways we're only
[1603.42s - 1604.42s] beginning to comprehend.
[1604.84s - 1605.04s] You know,
[1605.12s - 1606.52s] I think as you start
[1606.52s - 1608.14s] to tear down
[1608.14s - 1609.06s] that sort of
[1609.06s - 1609.68s] illusory
[1609.68s - 1611.46s] inter-societal scaffolding
[1611.46s - 1612.16s] as you mentioned.
[1612.36s - 1612.54s] You know,
[1612.62s - 1613.36s] those programs
[1613.36s - 1614.22s] and those beliefs
[1614.22s - 1615.16s] around self
[1615.16s - 1615.82s] and the world
[1615.82s - 1616.66s] and what's possible
[1616.66s - 1617.84s] and what we're worthy of.
[1618.36s - 1620.16s] You start to gain access
[1620.16s - 1622.10s] to deeper intuitive pulls
[1622.10s - 1622.50s] I think
[1622.50s - 1623.82s] for your life
[1623.82s - 1625.24s] and this is something
[1625.24s - 1626.90s] I've seen you speak to a lot
[1626.90s - 1628.40s] because I know
[1628.40s - 1629.14s] how big intuition
[1629.14s - 1630.04s] has been for you.
[1630.58s - 1631.66s] I want to get your perspective
[1631.66s - 1632.20s] on this
[1632.20s - 1633.26s] because we're having
[1633.26s - 1634.22s] more and more emerging
[1634.22s - 1635.48s] scientific understandings
[1635.48s - 1636.36s] of the inner workings
[1636.36s - 1638.08s] of what intuition really is.
[1638.14s - 1639.04s] I know you've studied it
[1639.04s - 1639.62s] as well
[1639.62s - 1641.66s] and leveraged it completely
[1641.66s - 1643.18s] to be able to design
[1643.18s - 1643.82s] your life
[1643.82s - 1644.66s] in a conscious
[1644.66s - 1645.72s] manner.
[1646.04s - 1647.54s] So how do you employ
[1647.54s - 1648.84s] intuition in your life?
[1648.92s - 1649.86s] How are you connected to it?
[1649.90s - 1650.68s] What do you feel it is?
[1651.54s - 1651.98s] Intuition
[1651.98s - 1654.30s] is a lot like
[1654.30s - 1656.55s] an internal AI.
[1657.27s - 1658.15s] Let me explain why.
[1658.96s - 1659.98s] A lot of people think AI
[1659.98s - 1661.56s] is this machine
[1661.56s - 1662.50s] in the clouds
[1662.50s - 1664.24s] separate from us.
[1664.46s - 1665.00s] It isn't.
[1665.56s - 1666.56s] You know what AI is?
[1666.56s - 1668.50s] It's technology
[1668.50s - 1669.82s] taking the grand
[1669.82s - 1670.44s] accumulation
[1670.44s - 1671.48s] of all of
[1671.48s - 1672.66s] human wisdom
[1672.66s - 1673.86s] creativity
[1673.86s - 1675.04s] art
[1675.04s - 1676.12s] knowledge
[1676.12s - 1677.62s] uniting it.
[1677.82s - 1678.18s] It's literally
[1678.18s - 1679.82s] uniting our brains
[1679.82s - 1681.52s] and creating a layer
[1681.52s - 1682.26s] on top of it
[1682.26s - 1683.18s] where
[1683.18s - 1684.66s] all of us
[1684.66s - 1685.42s] have access
[1685.42s - 1686.40s] to the collective
[1686.40s - 1687.18s] creativity
[1687.18s - 1687.86s] and intelligence
[1687.86s - 1688.56s] of humanity.
[1689.91s - 1690.01s] Right?
[1690.13s - 1690.67s] AI literally
[1690.67s - 1691.55s] scraped the internet

===REASONING STEPS===
Thought:
The chunk discusses the influence of thoughts and reality, and the importance of intuition. The speaker emphasizes that our thoughts can influence our reality and that intuition is a powerful tool for understanding and designing our lives. The text is rich in motivational and insightful content, but it is also quite complex and detailed. To fulfill the task, I will look for standalone, impactful quotes or sentences that can be used as motivational shorts. I will focus on lines that provide clear, actionable advice or inspiring insights.

[1698.71s - 1699.71s] create a poem
[1699.71s - 1700.93s] create an art piece
[1700.93s - 1701.55s] create a music
[1701.55s - 1702.31s] it's trained on
[1702.31s - 1703.31s] our collective work.
[1704.08s - 1704.64s] Now
[1704.64s - 1707.07s] I believe that
[1707.07s - 1707.95s] intuition is something
[1707.95s - 1708.37s] similar.
[1709.46s - 1710.48s] All of us
[1710.48s - 1711.18s] I believe
[1711.18s - 1711.96s] are deeply connected.
[1712.38s - 1714.76s] I don't think
[1714.76s - 1715.62s] we can explain that
[1715.62s - 1716.62s] scientifically yet
[1716.62s - 1717.81s] and maybe
[1717.81s - 1718.53s] quantum biology
[1718.53s - 1719.39s] will give us an answer
[1719.39s - 1720.85s] but all human beings
[1720.85s - 1721.73s] are deeply connected.
[1722.43s - 1723.25s] The closer you are
[1723.25s - 1723.71s] to someone
[1723.71s - 1724.49s] the more deeply
[1724.49s - 1725.35s] connected you are.
[1725.75s - 1726.17s] This is why
[1726.17s - 1727.37s] we sometimes sense things
[1727.37s - 1728.75s] about our
[1728.75s - 1729.55s] significant other.
[1730.17s - 1730.75s] This is sometimes
[1730.75s - 1731.89s] why a mother knows
[1731.89s - 1732.49s] when her child
[1732.49s - 1733.29s] is in distress.
[1733.95s - 1734.59s] There are so many
[1734.59s - 1735.45s] stories of this.
[1736.45s - 1737.07s] And through this
[1737.07s - 1737.85s] deep connection
[1737.85s - 1738.95s] this disconnection
[1738.95s - 1740.15s] of all of humanity
[1740.15s - 1741.76s] I believe
[1741.76s - 1742.38s] that's the source
[1742.38s - 1743.00s] of intuition.
[1743.92s - 1744.28s] So that
[1744.28s - 1745.14s] instinct
[1745.14s - 1746.26s] that insight
[1746.26s - 1746.92s] that idea
[1746.92s - 1747.60s] that you get
[1747.60s - 1749.87s] it's coming from
[1749.87s - 1751.53s] a larger
[1751.53s - 1752.63s] aspect of you
[1752.63s - 1754.20s] that's connected.
[1754.76s - 1755.46s] You and me
[1755.46s - 1756.34s] are connected.
[1756.34s - 1757.66s] You and everyone
[1757.66s - 1758.04s] else
[1758.04s - 1759.54s] in this neighborhood
[1759.54s - 1760.32s] in this city
[1760.32s - 1760.88s] in the world
[1760.88s - 1761.52s] are connected.
[1762.70s - 1763.48s] And intuition
[1763.48s - 1764.18s] is tapping
[1764.18s - 1765.28s] into that feel.
[1765.66s - 1765.98s] Carl Jung
[1765.98s - 1766.44s] called it
[1766.44s - 1767.34s] the morphogenetic feel.
[1768.06s - 1769.18s] Tapping into that feel
[1769.18s - 1770.40s] and being able
[1770.40s - 1771.06s] to source
[1771.06s - 1771.86s] insight.
[1773.50s - 1773.62s] Yeah.
[1773.82s - 1774.62s] Sheldrake too
[1774.62s - 1775.26s] is more
[1775.26s - 1776.18s] Rupert Sheldrake spoke
[1776.18s - 1777.08s] spoke about the same
[1777.08s - 1777.36s] thing.
[1777.42s - 1777.56s] Yeah.
[1777.66s - 1777.90s] Right?
[1778.36s - 1779.22s] The feeling of being
[1779.22s - 1780.00s] stared at.
[1780.24s - 1780.60s] He spoke
[1780.60s - 1781.14s] now it's the title
[1781.14s - 1781.48s] of his book
[1781.48s - 1782.00s] he spoke about
[1782.00s - 1783.04s] how sometimes
[1783.04s - 1783.54s] you'll be
[1783.54s - 1784.98s] walking somewhere
[1784.98s - 1785.72s] and you'll feel
[1785.72s - 1786.06s] like there's
[1786.06s - 1786.84s] someone behind you
[1786.84s - 1787.58s] staring at you
[1787.58s - 1788.85s] and you just
[1788.85s - 1789.13s] know.
[1789.57s - 1790.27s] You turn around
[1790.27s - 1791.49s] and sure enough
[1791.49s - 1792.45s] there's someone
[1792.45s - 1793.15s] staring at you
[1793.15s - 1793.65s] and that sounds
[1793.65s - 1794.21s] kind of creepy
[1794.21s - 1796.07s] but we have
[1796.07s - 1797.57s] these instincts.
[1797.57s - 1798.69s] Yeah I think
[1798.69s - 1799.59s] it's really
[1799.59s - 1800.25s] important to
[1800.25s - 1801.29s] demystify these
[1801.29s - 1802.05s] terms and
[1802.05s - 1805.61s] there's a book
[1805.61s - 1806.43s] actually around
[1806.43s - 1808.93s] this general
[1808.93s - 1809.73s] semantics called
[1809.73s - 1810.41s] the tyranny of
[1810.41s - 1810.97s] words that
[1810.97s - 1811.75s] describe how
[1811.75s - 1812.89s] we often use
[1812.89s - 1813.59s] words without
[1813.59s - 1814.23s] you know
[1814.23s - 1815.23s] understanding or
[1815.23s - 1815.93s] agreeing upon
[1815.93s - 1816.67s] what they actually
[1816.67s - 1817.07s] mean.
[1818.01s - 1818.49s] And so I think
[1818.49s - 1819.07s] it's really helpful
[1819.07s - 1819.93s] to demystify
[1819.93s - 1820.53s] words like
[1820.53s - 1821.01s] intuition
[1821.01s - 1822.29s] and the way
[1822.29s - 1822.85s] that you're
[1822.85s - 1823.73s] kind of comparing
[1823.73s - 1824.37s] it to a large
[1824.37s - 1824.89s] language model
[1824.89s - 1825.45s] for example
[1825.45s - 1826.73s] that we as
[1826.73s - 1827.29s] human beings
[1827.29s - 1827.91s] have access
[1827.91s - 1829.39s] to all of
[1829.39s - 1830.11s] our historical
[1830.11s - 1830.93s] experiences
[1830.93s - 1831.65s] of course
[1831.65s - 1832.13s] genetically
===INPUT CHUNK END===

===REASONING STEPS===
Thought:
The chunk discusses the concept of intuition and its connection to our collective experiences and the world around us. The speaker emphasizes the idea that intuition is a deeper connection to something larger than ourselves, often tapping into a collective consciousness. The text is rich in philosophical and psychological insights, but it lacks a clear, standalone motivational message. Therefore, no qualifying snippets are found that meet the criteria for a motivational short.

[1854.31s - 1854.71s] exciting
[1854.71s - 1855.89s] and of course
[1855.89s - 1856.25s] we don't have

[1868.75s - 1869.41s] with intuition
[1869.41s - 1870.07s] as it can

[1915.00s - 1915.92s] you go on
[1915.92s - 1916.42s] a blind date
[1916.42s - 1916.80s] or something

[1917.56s - 1918.68s] I had an

[1919.04s - 1919.62s] of clairaudience
[1919.62s - 1920.14s] that saved

[1923.12s - 1923.70s] 2008
[1923.70s - 1924.44s] the Black Eyed

[1924.96s - 1925.92s] My Humps
[1925.92s - 1926.54s] had come out

[1927.79s - 1928.07s] loved the

[1928.45s - 1928.63s] Peas
[1928.63s - 1928.93s] so I was

[1929.37s - 1929.71s] the road
[1929.71s - 1930.89s] and the

Thought:
The chunk discusses the concept of intuition and its role in various aspects of life, including personal relationships and decision-making. The text is rich in insights about how intuition can guide us and save our lives. The task is to extract powerful, standalone motivational snippets that can be used in a motivational short video. I will look for complete thoughts that are inspiring, insightful, and can stand alone without needing additional context.

[1938.65s - 1939.53s] it was so
[1939.53s - 1939.95s] awesome
[1939.95s - 1940.31s] and so
[1940.31s - 1941.55s] all of a sudden
[1941.55s - 1942.67s] I heard a
[1942.67s - 1943.09s] voice
[1943.09s - 1944.43s] this is wild
[1944.43s - 1944.63s] right
[1944.63s - 1945.15s] I heard a
[1945.15s - 1945.53s] voice like
[1945.53s - 1945.81s] there was
[1945.81s - 1946.19s] someone in
[1946.19s - 1946.55s] the backseat
[1946.55s - 1946.97s] of my car
[1946.97s - 1947.57s] saying pay
[1947.57s - 1948.33s] attention to
[1948.33s - 1948.79s] the road
[1948.79s - 1951.51s] and it
[1951.51s - 1951.93s] brought my
[1951.93s - 1952.29s] mind off
[1952.29s - 1952.75s] the song
[1952.75s - 1953.43s] back to
[1953.43s - 1953.81s] the road
[1953.81s - 1954.95s] and just
[1954.95s - 1955.31s] then a
[1955.31s - 1955.67s] truck
[1955.67s - 1956.47s] hit a
[1956.47s - 1956.73s] car
[1956.73s - 1957.71s] the car
[1957.71s - 1958.47s] flipped up
[1958.47s - 1959.41s] landed
[1959.41s - 1960.23s] in front
[1960.23s - 1960.47s] of me
[1960.47s - 1961.31s] and I
[1961.31s - 1961.83s] had just
[1961.83s - 1962.21s] enough time
[1962.21s - 1962.57s] to break
[1962.57s - 1963.98s] and it
[1963.98s - 1964.44s] was wild
[1964.44s - 1965.28s] right
[1965.28s - 1965.50s] and I
[1965.52s - 1966.74s] possibly
[1966.74s - 1967.06s] would have
[1967.06s - 1967.50s] hit that
[1967.50s - 1967.76s] car
[1967.76s - 1968.72s] if I
[1968.72s - 1968.96s] hadn't
[1968.96s - 1969.32s] heard that
[1969.32s - 1969.60s] voice
[1969.60s - 1970.84s] but I
[1970.84s - 1971.34s] swear it
[1971.34s - 1971.66s] felt like
[1971.66s - 1971.82s] it was
[1971.82s - 1972.14s] coming from
[1972.14s - 1972.66s] the backseat
[1972.66s - 1973.20s] there was
[1973.20s - 1973.62s] no one
[1973.62s - 1973.80s] in the
[1973.80s - 1974.20s] backseat
[1974.20s - 1975.24s] so what
[1975.24s - 1975.58s] voice
[1975.58s - 1976.28s] was that
[1976.28s - 1976.70s] voice
[1976.70s - 1977.04s] to this
[1977.04s - 1977.22s] day
[1977.22s - 1977.46s] I
[1977.46s - 1977.76s] don't
[1977.76s - 1977.96s] know
[1977.96s - 1978.64s] but it
[1978.64s - 1978.98s] was a
[1978.98s - 1979.30s] voice
[1979.30s - 1980.38s] that
[1980.38s - 1980.78s] is
[1980.78s - 1981.30s] clairaudience
[1981.30s - 1981.90s] a form
[1981.90s - 1982.50s] of intuition
[1982.50s - 1984.00s] it's
[1984.00s - 1984.02s] it's
[1984.02s - 1984.72s] so fascinating
[1984.72s - 1985.04s] to
[1985.04s - 1986.60s] look at
[1986.60s - 1987.68s] look at
[1987.68s - 1988.18s] the research
[1988.18s - 1988.70s] and how
[1988.70s - 1989.40s] much
[1989.40s - 1990.54s] information
[1990.54s - 1991.50s] is available
[1991.50s - 1991.90s] to our
[1991.90s - 1992.26s] sensory
[1992.26s - 1992.74s] experience
[1992.74s - 1993.08s] at any
[1993.08s - 1993.30s] given
[1993.30s - 1993.64s] moment
[1993.64s - 1994.06s] and yet
[1994.06s - 1994.96s] what we're
[1994.96s - 1995.90s] consciously
[1995.90s - 1996.62s] aware of
[1996.62s - 1996.98s] is a
[1996.98s - 1997.30s] small
[1997.30s - 1997.54s] small
[1997.54s - 1997.92s] less than

[1998.28s - 1998.72s] fraction

[1999.76s - 2000.08s] none
[2000.08s - 2000.28s] other
[2000.28s - 2000.88s] than
[2000.88s - 2001.60s] it would
[2001.60s - 2001.86s] just be
[2001.86s - 2002.14s] simply
[2002.14s - 2002.68s] overwhelming
[2002.68s - 2003.40s] to be
[2003.40s - 2003.80s] perceiving
[2003.80s - 2004.16s] all that
[2004.16s - 2004.54s] we have
[2004.54s - 2005.10s] access to
[2005.10s - 2005.60s] or connected
[2005.60s - 2005.92s] to
[2005.92s - 2007.48s] but the
[2007.48s - 2007.76s] fact that
[2007.76s - 2008.00s] we are
[2008.00s - 2008.30s] connected
[2008.30s - 2008.68s] to it
[2008.68s - 2009.24s] allows us
[2009.24s - 2010.00s] to tune
[2010.00s - 2010.68s] into that
[2010.68s - 2011.26s] you know
[2011.26s - 2011.52s] and
[2011.52s - 2012.78s] what do
[2012.78s - 2013.00s] you think
[2013.00s - 2013.24s] is the
[2013.24s - 2013.66s] relationship
[2013.66s - 2014.14s] to
[2014.14s - 2014.70s] intuition
[2014.70s - 2015.92s] and getting
[2015.92s - 2016.44s] quiet
[2016.44s - 2017.84s] and feeling
[2017.84s - 2018.32s] open
[2018.32s - 2018.82s] internally
[2018.82s - 2019.56s] and that
[2019.56s - 2020.44s] sort of
[2020.44s - 2021.18s] relaxed
[2021.18s - 2021.76s] state
[2021.76s - 2022.48s] of mind
[2022.48s - 2023.52s] and how
[2023.52s - 2023.94s] that
[2023.94s - 2025.08s] opens up
[2025.08s - 2025.50s] your intuitive
[2025.50s - 2026.12s] capacities
[2026.12s - 2027.38s] so studies
[2027.38s - 2027.88s] in intuition
[2027.88s - 2028.86s] show that
[2028.86s - 2029.32s] when
[2029.32s - 2030.26s] it
[2030.26s - 2030.80s] correlates

===REASONING STEPS===
Thought:
The chunk provided is a transcript of a motivational podcast. The overall context is about the speaker's experience with intuition and how it can be cultivated. The speaker discusses a voice they heard in their car, which they believe was a form of clairaudience, a type of intuition. The speaker also talks about the relationship between intuition and getting quiet and feeling open internally.

The task is to extract motivational text that is complete, standalone, and impactful. I will look for quotes or passages that provide clear advice, insight, or inspiration. I will ensure that the text is self-contained and can be understood without additional context.

[0.00s - 3.28s] Whatever rules you decide are true, become true for you.
[3.52s - 4.52s] If you think about human history,
[4.64s - 7.56s] we've been slaving away for the longest time.
[7.82s - 9.84s] What's about to happen in 2025
[9.84s - 12.84s] is that the definition of success is changing.
[13.02s - 14.90s] This is the perfect time for us
[14.90s - 17.08s] to fully, fully embrace what we love.
[17.22s - 18.78s] What we should be teaching adults to do
[18.78s - 20.04s] is to answer eight questions.
[20.28s - 21.48s] Answer these eight questions,
[21.84s - 23.86s] and I think you'll be setting your life up
[23.86s - 27.48s] for a lot of beauty, elegance, happiness, and success.
[27.48s - 29.56s] And what people don't even know
[29.56s - 33.56s] is this, stop trying to glorify hustle culture.
[33.66s - 35.60s] Hustle culture is a thing of the past.
[35.90s - 37.52s] This is what I'm trying to wake people up to.
[38.06s - 39.62s] We have two great spiritual needs,
[39.80s - 41.52s] the need to grow and the need to contribute.
[41.94s - 43.14s] And you have that purpose.
[43.34s - 45.24s] You have more fuel, you have more energy,
[45.38s - 46.94s] you have more excitement about life,
[47.00s - 47.92s] you feel more fulfilled.
[48.04s - 49.56s] But if everyone was doing that,
[49.72s - 51.88s] imagine how beautiful the world would be.
[57.51s - 60.21s] Hey everyone, welcome back to the Know Thyself Podcast.
[60.57s - 63.31s] Our guest today is a best-selling author,
[63.31s - 65.29s] founder, and CEO of Mindvalley,
[65.47s - 68.11s] which is a global education company
[68.11s - 71.15s] that is transforming the way we think about self-help,
[71.27s - 72.69s] personal development, well-being.
[73.19s - 75.37s] And it's been a pleasure to develop our friendship
[75.37s - 76.33s] over the past couple of years
[76.33s - 78.95s] and see the inspiring work he's really stewarding
[78.95s - 81.59s] and pioneering in the space of helping people
[81.59s - 83.13s] come back home to themselves
[83.13s - 85.91s] and become powerful creators in the world.
[86.15s - 87.71s] Vishen Lakhiani, thank you for being here.
[87.77s - 88.39s] Thank you, Andre.
[88.39s - 90.55s] By the way, this is an amazing set.
[91.89s - 93.43s] Thank you, I appreciate it.
[93.43s - 94.19s] It's just so soothing.
[94.95s - 96.11s] It's so peaceful.
[96.35s - 98.23s] I've never been in a podcast set like that.
[98.59s - 102.35s] It feels like you're in a spa, not a studio.
[102.59s - 105.73s] Yeah, I try to make these conversations,
[106.11s - 107.53s] like the atmosphere feel a little bit more
[107.53s - 110.55s] like a ceremony than just casual.
[111.55s - 112.81s] And so I'm glad it's cozy.
[113.09s - 114.39s] Also, this tea is amazing.
[114.59s - 114.81s] Yeah.
[114.89s - 116.13s] I don't even know what you put in here.
[116.81s - 117.65s] It's the stuff from Peak.
[117.75s - 119.93s] They're a sponsor, so I'm glad you like it.
[120.07s - 120.39s] Amazing.
[121.21s - 124.29s] Man, there are so many amazing avenues
[124.29s - 125.77s] I'm excited to explore with you.
[125.77s - 130.31s] I really love individuals that are playing at a big scale
[130.31s - 132.67s] that are very aligned with a message
[132.67s - 134.47s] and vehicle of service to the planet.
[135.45s - 137.41s] I'm sure it's evolved over the years for you,
[137.49s - 139.91s] but how do you currently, as of today,
[140.15s - 142.27s] define what success means to you?
[142.81s - 146.39s] So the definition of success is changing
[146.39s - 150.57s] only because we, in 2025, literally this year,
[150.73s - 152.97s] we're entering a new era of humanity.
[153.33s - 158.43s] And that is the era of human beings working with AI
[158.43s - 162.53s] to not just transform the world, build companies,
[163.07s - 165.05s] but to make work dematerialize.
[165.55s - 167.47s] So if you think about human history, right,
[167.93s - 171.79s] we've been slaving away for the longest time,
[171.79s - 175.79s] ever since we moved from being hunter-gatherers to farmers.
[176.47s - 177.67s] Now, the hunter-gatherer lifestyle
[177.67s - 179.45s] was actually a superior lifestyle.
[180.23s - 183.51s] I mean, day one, you're hiking through a forest,
[183.75s - 184.55s] hunting animals.
[184.55s - 187.23s] You'd probably be done with your work in two or three hours,
[187.59s - 188.35s] have enough to eat,
[188.71s - 190.43s] and then spend the rest of your time with nature,
[190.59s - 191.15s] with family.
[191.65s - 194.05s] But when we moved to farming and growing crops,
[194.31s - 195.39s] life got really hard.
[201.79s - 202.91s] Increasing and increasing.
[203.01s - 204.63s] Because first, you're managing the crops,
[205.11s - 207.09s] then you are, or if you're not managing the crops,
[207.17s - 208.89s] you're building the tools to harvest the crops,
[209.43s - 211.79s] or you're working on farms owned by landowners.
[212.15s - 213.33s] And it got to a point where,

[213.59s - 214.55s] about 100 years ago,
[215.09s - 217.53s] Americans were working 12 hours a day,
[217.89s - 218.73s] seven days a week.
[219.25s - 220.47s] Then Henry Ford comes along,
[220.89s - 222.23s] and he changes the work dynamic,
[222.51s - 223.77s] and he gives us the modern
[223.77s - 225.89s] eight to nine-hour-a-day,
[225.99s - 226.77s] five-day work week.
[226.77s - 229.37s] And this continues until now.
[230.33s - 232.53s] What's about to happen in 2025
[232.53s - 234.05s] is that next big shift.
[234.15s - 236.13s] And this shift is as big
[236.13s - 239.15s] as going from hunter-gatherers to agriculturists.
[239.73s - 240.65s] And that shift is,
[241.23s - 244.45s] AI and robotics are going to start taking off,
[244.81s - 246.45s] taking over a lot of our work.
[247.11s - 248.19s] What's going to happen?
[248.29s - 250.07s] Bill Gates just announced this last week.
[250.47s - 252.47s] We're about to enter a two-day work week.
[253.17s - 254.15s] Not only that,
[254.55s - 255.71s] but just recently,
[255.71s - 258.67s] one of the many robotic companies around the world,
[258.77s - 260.29s] there are around 30, 40 robotic companies,
[260.39s - 261.09s] they estimate it to be,
[261.75s - 263.55s] at a conservative level,
[263.89s - 266.35s] a million humanoid robots in the workforce
[266.35s - 268.91s] within the next three or four years, right?
[269.41s - 270.85s] So one of these robotic companies
[270.85s - 274.31s] just announced that figure,
[274.43s - 275.25s] figures named the company,
[275.73s - 277.15s] that we'll have robots in our homes
[277.15s - 278.25s] in around two to three years
[278.25s - 280.55s] because they're making such rapid progress.
[281.33s - 283.83s] And what people don't even know is this.
[283.83s - 285.79s] As amazing as things are right now,
[286.55s - 288.77s] AI is doubling in power,
[289.11s - 289.75s] cost of power,
[290.09s - 291.31s] every 3.3 months.
[291.91s - 293.03s] So in the next one year,
[293.25s - 294.85s] it's going to increase by 16 times.
[295.21s - 296.49s] In the next 24 months,
[296.77s - 298.05s] 256 times.
[298.57s - 299.49s] And in the next five years,
[299.57s - 300.41s] can you guess how many times?
[301.35s - 302.11s] One million.
[302.85s - 303.87s] It's exponential.
[304.57s - 306.45s] If it's doubling every 3.3 months,
[306.69s - 307.43s] in five years,
[307.51s - 308.75s] it's a million times more powerful.
[309.39s - 311.15s] So when AI is a million times more powerful,
[311.15s - 312.49s] what is going to happen?
[312.99s - 314.97s] And that AI that's a million times more powerful
[314.97s - 316.67s] now in robotic bodies,
[317.15s - 319.19s] not only are white-collar jobs going to disappear,
[319.47s - 320.99s] blue-collar jobs are going to disappear.
[321.55s - 324.53s] Universal basic income is not a question of if.
[324.91s - 326.25s] It's now a question of when.
[326.71s - 327.25s] And by the way,
[327.69s - 328.49s] Elon said that.
[329.43s - 330.77s] And so what we're about to enter
[330.77s - 333.25s] is a world of abundance.
[333.69s - 335.77s] Except it's no longer the hunter-gatherer world
[335.77s - 338.07s] where you work for two hours
[338.07s - 339.45s] and you don't have a roof over your head.
[339.49s - 340.55s] But, you know, you're in nature.
[340.99s - 341.77s] We're entering a world
[341.77s - 343.91s] where we have everything we need.
[344.67s - 346.49s] But we may only have to work
[346.49s - 347.55s] one or two hours a day.
[348.45s - 350.73s] That is crazy exciting.
[351.11s - 352.31s] But that also means
[352.31s - 353.65s] that how we set goals
[353.65s - 354.95s] is going to have to change.
[355.09s - 356.45s] Money is going to become less important.
[356.93s - 358.15s] What you do with your free time,
[358.29s - 359.59s] that's going to be more important.
[360.49s - 362.57s] And so the way we are
[362.57s - 364.11s] measuring our goals,
[364.49s - 365.61s] human beings all around the world,
[365.61s - 366.95s] is often, you know,
[367.07s - 369.01s] like reinforced by culture.
[369.63s - 370.77s] Culture is about to get
[370.77s - 371.67s] completely disrupted.
[372.99s - 374.49s] In the midst of culture
[374.49s - 375.19s] getting disrupted,
[375.19s - 376.57s] I think it's really important
[376.57s - 377.69s] to distill down
[377.69s - 379.27s] and get clear as an individual
[379.27s - 380.47s] when reflecting on
[380.47s - 382.39s] what is going to be
[382.39s - 384.51s] the most meaningful endeavor in my life.
[384.61s - 386.01s] What direction do I want to go in?
[386.41s - 387.37s] And I think of how
[387.37s - 389.75s] the potential of a seed
[389.75s - 391.51s] is encoded with it from the start.
[392.03s - 395.19s] And so even before we go out
[395.19s - 396.25s] and want to create
[396.25s - 397.51s] or contribute to the world
[397.51s - 398.29s] however we might,
[398.65s - 399.59s] it would be really wise
[399.59s - 400.43s] to spend time
[400.43s - 401.49s] and really contemplate

[552.05s - 552.89s] so much time
[552.89s - 554.29s] thinking about education
[554.29s - 555.97s] from a new paradigm
[555.97s - 556.91s] perspective
[556.91s - 558.01s] and trying to
[558.01s - 559.25s] bring more unity
[559.25s - 559.75s] on the planet
[559.75s - 560.73s] and democratize it
[560.73s - 561.59s] in such a big way,
[562.01s - 562.77s] what comes up
[562.77s - 563.11s] for you
[563.11s - 563.87s] in this new chapter
[563.87s - 564.31s] of your life?
[564.49s - 565.31s] So I was writing
[565.31s - 565.83s] down my goals
[565.83s - 566.21s] recently,
[566.33s - 566.51s] right?
[566.65s - 567.73s] And this thought
[567.73s - 568.31s] occurred to me.
[568.71s - 568.99s] School.
[569.63s - 570.63s] School prepared us
[570.63s - 572.05s] according to Calvin Coolidge
[572.05s - 573.05s] in the 1920s.
[573.99s - 574.85s] The point of education
[574.85s - 575.99s] is to create
[575.99s - 577.45s] cogs in the wheels
[577.45s - 578.37s] of industry.
[580.17s - 580.93s] That doesn't sound
[580.93s - 581.69s] like a really healthy way
[581.69s - 582.19s] of like raising
[582.19s - 582.77s] human beings,
[582.85s - 583.07s] right?
[583.53s - 584.05s] But we've been doing
[584.05s - 585.33s] that for a really long time.
[586.13s - 586.69s] I think
[586.69s - 587.91s] that whole system
[587.91s - 588.93s] is now
[588.93s - 589.99s] ripe for disruption.
[591.67s - 592.21s] I think
[592.21s - 592.93s] what we should be
[592.93s - 593.63s] teaching adults
[593.63s - 594.01s] to do
[594.01s - 594.73s] is to answer
[594.73s - 595.47s] eight questions.
[596.35s - 596.65s] Now,
[596.77s - 597.33s] to make it easy
[597.33s - 597.75s] to understand,
[597.95s - 598.51s] I'd like to share
[598.51s - 599.01s] these questions
[599.01s - 599.97s] with your audience
[599.97s - 601.15s] and they spell out
[601.15s - 601.53s] the word
[601.53s - 603.81s] S-O-U-L-P-A-C-T
[603.81s - 604.83s] soul pact.
[605.61s - 606.29s] So I
[606.29s - 607.17s] put it together
[607.17s - 609.01s] in this
[609.01s - 610.41s] simple
[610.41s - 611.33s] abbreviation
[611.33s - 612.19s] so it's easy
[612.19s - 612.65s] to remember.
[613.81s - 614.13s] Answer
[614.13s - 615.25s] these eight questions
[615.25s - 616.17s] and I think
[616.17s - 616.79s] you'll be setting
[616.79s - 617.81s] your life up
[617.81s - 618.87s] for a lot
[618.87s - 619.41s] of beauty,
[619.83s - 620.31s] elegance,
[620.49s - 620.79s] happiness
[620.79s - 622.07s] and success.
[622.85s - 623.75s] The first question
[623.75s - 624.43s] is this
[624.43s - 624.97s] basically
[624.97s - 626.13s] simplicity.
[627.39s - 627.91s] Simplicity
[627.91s - 628.85s] should be a goal.
[629.69s - 630.51s] There's elegance
[630.51s - 631.25s] in simplicity.
[632.35s - 633.25s] If you're writing
[633.25s - 633.77s] down a goal,
[634.59s - 635.31s] your goal
[635.31s - 635.93s] might be something
[635.93s - 636.85s] along these lines.
[637.85s - 639.09s] I run my business
[639.09s - 640.47s] with only,
[640.97s - 641.99s] underline only,
[642.91s - 643.55s] five people,
[644.09s - 644.65s] three people,
[645.23s - 646.67s] with only five people
[646.67s - 647.17s] and a swarm
[647.17s - 648.05s] of AI agents.
[648.55s - 649.13s] Peter Diamandis
[649.13s - 649.59s] said the next
[649.59s - 650.05s] billion dollar
[650.05s - 650.63s] companies are going
[650.63s - 650.95s] to be built
[650.95s - 651.69s] by teams of one,
[651.77s - 652.21s] two or three.
[652.21s - 653.21s] Today I listened
[653.21s - 653.79s] to an interview
[653.79s - 655.33s] with a college kid,
[655.41s - 656.07s] 19 years old.
[656.15s - 656.55s] His company
[656.55s - 657.35s] just got a valuation
[657.35s - 658.95s] of two billion.
[660.29s - 661.27s] A 19-year-old kid
[661.27s - 662.97s] and under 20 employees.
[664.01s - 664.71s] It's wild,
[665.01s - 665.27s] right?
[665.73s - 667.31s] So simplicity
[667.31s - 668.95s] needs to be
[668.95s - 669.79s] an art form.
[670.05s - 670.61s] We don't want
[670.61s - 671.47s] complexity in our life.
[671.57s - 672.47s] That's the first S.
[673.15s - 673.53s] That's funny
[673.53s - 673.91s] because I think
[673.91s - 674.31s] a lot of people
[674.31s - 674.83s] would hear that
[674.83s - 675.31s] and think that
[675.31s - 676.19s] is not simplicity
[676.19s - 676.93s] in terms of
[676.93s - 677.85s] having 20 employees
[677.85s - 678.23s] or building
[678.23s - 678.77s] a billion dollar
[678.77s - 679.41s] company.
[679.41s - 680.19s] But in terms
[680.19s - 681.23s] of how compared
[681.23s - 682.07s] to how things
[682.07s - 682.51s] have been done
[682.51s - 683.13s] in the past,
[683.27s - 684.03s] there is this
[684.03s - 684.81s] distillation
[684.81s - 686.33s] and simplifying
[686.33s - 688.73s] of leveraging
[688.73s - 689.33s] intelligence
[689.33s - 690.23s] in ways that
[690.23s - 691.51s] have that
[691.51s - 692.65s] multiplicative effect.
[693.53s - 693.93s] Okay,
[694.01s - 694.59s] so S.
[694.85s - 696.03s] So that's the S.
[696.59s - 696.73s] Okay,

===REASONING STEPS===
Thought:
The chunk discusses the importance of simplicity in education and business, suggesting that the current education system is outdated and ripe for disruption. The speaker introduces the concept of "soul pact" and eight questions to guide adults in setting their lives up for success. The text is rich in motivational content, but we need to ensure that the saved text is complete, impactful, and can stand alone as a motivational short.

[854.69s - 854.99s] right?
[855.83s - 856.13s] That was
[856.13s - 856.49s] amazing,
[856.61s - 856.79s] right?
[856.89s - 857.17s] Like we
[857.17s - 857.67s] spent what
[857.67s - 857.97s] seven,
[858.09s - 858.47s] eight days

[859.33s - 859.63s] but all
[859.63s - 859.83s] of us
[859.83s - 860.09s] could do
[860.09s - 860.57s] it because
[860.57s - 861.39s] in our
[861.39s - 861.87s] lives we
[861.87s - 862.19s] had created
[862.19s - 862.77s] space for
[862.77s - 863.35s] opportunity.
[864.11s - 864.27s] And I
[864.27s - 865.23s] think bringing
[865.23s - 865.81s] this a little
[865.81s - 866.21s] bit to the
[866.21s - 866.79s] micro level
[866.79s - 867.15s] too,
[867.39s - 867.71s] there's
[867.71s - 868.39s] space for

[868.89s - 869.63s] within our

[884.35s - 885.65s] arise that
[885.65s - 886.49s] are perhaps
[886.49s - 886.93s] greater than
[886.93s - 887.21s] we could
[887.21s - 887.97s] conceive of.
[888.21s - 888.87s] And so I
[888.87s - 889.45s] like that idea
[889.45s - 889.83s] of creating
[889.83s - 890.35s] space for
[890.35s - 891.13s] opportunity both
[891.13s - 891.37s] at the
[891.37s - 892.17s] macro scale in
[892.17s - 892.59s] terms of our
[892.59s - 893.19s] calendar in
[893.19s - 893.67s] our life but
[893.67s - 894.19s] then also
[894.19s - 895.21s] within our
[895.21s - 896.65s] daily moments
[896.65s - 896.91s] too.
[896.91s - 898.51s] so the goal
[898.51s - 898.89s] that you want
[898.89s - 899.11s] to write
[899.11s - 899.79s] down is I
[899.79s - 900.45s] create space
[900.45s - 901.17s] for opportunity
[901.17s - 902.75s] by and
[902.75s - 902.97s] then it
[902.97s - 903.37s] could be
[903.37s - 903.79s] keeping
[903.79s - 904.57s] Fridays free
[904.57s - 906.15s] or keeping
[906.15s - 907.01s] or stopping
[907.01s - 907.69s] work after
[907.69s - 909.33s] 5pm so I
[909.33s - 909.97s] can focus on
[909.97s - 910.41s] learning and
[910.41s - 910.71s] growth.
[911.55s - 911.81s] Amazing.
[912.05s - 912.23s] Okay.
[912.49s - 913.01s] So what's the
[913.01s - 913.19s] U?
[913.45s - 914.15s] The U is
[914.15s - 914.77s] unique edge.
[915.45s - 915.93s] Unique edge.
[915.93s - 916.27s] The question
[916.27s - 917.81s] there is I
[917.81s - 918.85s] am known
[918.85s - 920.23s] in the world
[920.23s - 922.75s] for and
[922.75s - 924.17s] describe that.
[924.17s - 925.27s] So in a
[925.27s - 925.51s] world of
[925.51s - 925.79s] AI,
[926.27s - 926.97s] generative AI
[926.97s - 928.39s] can create
[928.39s - 929.33s] that scene
[929.33s - 929.83s] from that
[929.83s - 931.05s] Will Smith
[931.05s - 931.43s] movie,
[931.67s - 932.07s] I, Robot.

===REASONING STEPS===
Thought:
The chunk provided is a motivational transcript discussing the importance of creating space for opportunities in life. The speaker emphasizes the need to allocate time and resources to projects and personal growth, rather than letting them expand and consume all available time. The text is rich in advice and insights, but it is also quite detailed and may not be suitable for a short motivational video without some editing.

[1060.18s - 1060.86s] expression in
[1060.86s - 1061.78s] life, both in
[1061.78s - 1063.22s] terms of our
[1063.22s - 1064.90s] creative arts, our
[1064.90s - 1065.76s] businesses, our
[1065.76s - 1066.68s] families, and the
[1066.68s - 1067.90s] world, and we're
[1067.90s - 1068.80s] all unique humans.
[1068.98s - 1069.64s] All life and
[1069.64s - 1070.46s] nature is a
[1070.46s - 1071.26s] unique expression,
[1071.40s - 1071.62s] right?
[1071.70s - 1072.70s] And I've
[1072.70s - 1073.56s] enjoyed seeing
[1073.56s - 1074.84s] content and
[1074.84s - 1075.68s] conversations of
[1075.68s - 1076.24s] yours over the
[1076.24s - 1077.06s] years talking about
[1077.06s - 1077.76s] this distinction
[1077.76s - 1078.92s] between authentic
[1078.92s - 1080.22s] desires and
[1080.22s - 1081.28s] goals, which are
[1081.28s - 1082.70s] culturally conditioned,
[1082.98s - 1083.44s] you know, like,
[1083.56s - 1084.26s] for example, our
[1084.26s - 1084.90s] notions of what
[1084.90s - 1085.62s] success means.
[1086.40s - 1087.00s] And so when you
[1087.00s - 1087.54s] think about that
[1087.54s - 1088.38s] distinction, if we
[1088.38s - 1089.40s] want to unlock and
[1089.40s - 1090.28s] reveal our unique
[1090.28s - 1091.78s] expression, how do
[1091.78s - 1092.44s] you distill down
[1092.44s - 1092.80s] what your
[1092.80s - 1093.62s] authentic desires
[1093.62s - 1093.90s] are?
[1093.98s - 1094.54s] Is that the kind
[1094.54s - 1095.16s] of the revealing
[1095.16s - 1096.12s] process for that?
[1096.76s - 1098.48s] So this brings us
[1098.48s - 1098.90s] to the fourth
[1098.90s - 1099.40s] one, right?
[1099.40s - 1100.46s] Which is L, and
[1100.46s - 1101.20s] L simply stands
[1101.20s - 1101.78s] for love.
[1102.40s - 1103.34s] So what is it
[1103.34s - 1105.14s] that you enjoy
[1105.14s - 1105.56s] doing?
[1106.02s - 1106.98s] Even if you
[1106.98s - 1108.06s] don't get any
[1108.06s - 1109.50s] likes, you can
[1109.50s - 1110.06s] share it on your
[1110.06s - 1111.90s] Pinterest board, and
[1111.90s - 1112.34s] you aren't going to
[1112.34s - 1113.00s] get paid for it.
[1114.16s - 1116.70s] So love, part of
[1116.70s - 1117.58s] that can be a
[1117.58s - 1117.98s] unique edge.
[1118.02s - 1118.32s] So let me give
[1118.32s - 1118.76s] you an example.
[1119.28s - 1119.96s] When I was young, I
[1119.96s - 1120.48s] was deep into
[1120.48s - 1121.16s] martial arts.
[1121.34s - 1122.08s] Like, I got all
[1122.08s - 1122.52s] the way to a
[1122.52s - 1124.30s] second degree
[1124.30s - 1125.20s] black belt in
[1125.20s - 1125.64s] taekwondo.
[1125.64s - 1128.48s] And I was so
[1128.48s - 1129.30s] into martial arts
[1129.30s - 1129.64s] that I would
[1129.64s - 1130.46s] have to take
[1130.46s - 1131.00s] time off from
[1131.00s - 1132.58s] school to compete
[1132.58s - 1133.16s] in competitions.
[1134.04s - 1134.56s] And I remember
[1134.56s - 1135.74s] a teacher told me,
[1135.96s - 1136.44s] why are you doing
[1136.44s - 1136.78s] this?
[1137.10s - 1137.78s] You're never going
[1137.78s - 1138.40s] to make money in
[1138.40s - 1139.08s] martial arts.
[1139.66s - 1140.36s] What's the point?
[1140.88s - 1141.62s] My dream at that
[1141.62s - 1142.34s] time was to open a
[1142.34s - 1142.62s] dojo.
[1143.02s - 1143.92s] Maybe I'd watch like
[1143.92s - 1144.46s] one too many
[1144.46s - 1145.34s] karate kid movies.
[1145.58s - 1146.34s] I wanted to be
[1146.34s - 1147.08s] like the Malaysian
[1147.08s - 1147.52s] Miyagi.
[1148.38s - 1149.36s] And for a while, I
[1149.36s - 1149.70s] believed that
[1149.70s - 1150.20s] school teacher.
[1150.80s - 1151.26s] But that school
[1151.26s - 1152.00s] teacher was wrong.
[1152.82s - 1154.76s] So I followed
[1154.76s - 1155.66s] martial arts
[1155.66s - 1156.54s] because of love.
[1156.94s - 1157.98s] I got to a level
[1157.98s - 1159.78s] where I got to
[1159.78s - 1160.42s] compete and
[1160.42s - 1161.14s] represent my country
[1161.14s - 1162.00s] Malaysia in the
[1162.00s - 1162.54s] US Open.
[1163.02s - 1163.68s] That was my first
[1163.68s - 1164.28s] time setting foot
[1164.28s - 1164.78s] in America.
[1165.36s - 1166.62s] My God, Andre, I
[1166.62s - 1167.46s] fell in love with
[1167.46s - 1167.96s] this country.
[1168.62s - 1169.24s] And so although I
[1169.24s - 1169.74s] went to a British
[1169.74s - 1170.20s] school and I was
[1170.20s - 1170.84s] supposed to go to
[1170.84s - 1171.54s] university in the
[1171.54s - 1173.04s] UK, I decided to
[1173.04s - 1173.32s] divert.
[1174.18s - 1175.20s] I lost a year, but
[1175.20s - 1175.80s] I decided to go
[1175.80s - 1176.60s] and study in the
[1176.60s - 1177.32s] United States.
[1177.90s - 1178.42s] Now, of course, I
[1178.42s - 1179.14s] had no idea about
[1179.14s - 1180.20s] American geography, so
[1180.20s - 1181.02s] I stupidly picked
[1181.02s - 1181.58s] Michigan.
[1182.00s - 1183.62s] The coldest, one of
[1183.62s - 1184.74s] the coldest states
[1184.74s - 1185.16s] possible.

[1322.22s - 1323.04s] computer engineering.
[1323.88s - 1324.68s] So remember I said

[1325.74s - 1326.30s] can combine two
[1326.30s - 1326.62s] things.
[1326.92s - 1327.48s] I combined
[1327.48s - 1328.52s] engineering with
[1328.52s - 1329.06s] meditation.
[1329.06s - 1330.14s] meditation, built a

[1332.12s - 1333.40s] went to a hundred
[1333.40s - 1334.14s] million in revenue.
[1335.36s - 1336.18s] It's really

[1350.74s - 1352.06s] quite the journey that
[1352.06s - 1353.00s] you've been on in
[1353.00s - 1353.90s] regards to that.
[1353.90s - 1355.02s] I've seen you talk
[1355.02s - 1356.12s] about the
[1356.12s - 1357.28s] rules, you know,
[1357.40s - 1359.36s] and these BS
[1359.36s - 1360.92s] rules that we
[1360.92s - 1362.58s] subconsciously are
[1362.58s - 1364.34s] essentially programmed
[1364.34s - 1365.64s] by to live by
[1365.64s - 1366.44s] culturally,
[1366.64s - 1367.18s] familiarly.
[1367.64s - 1368.20s] I want to continue
[1368.20s - 1368.66s] with your soul
[1368.66s - 1369.50s] pact, but I'm just
[1369.50s - 1370.30s] curious what comes
[1370.30s - 1371.32s] up for you when
[1371.32s - 1372.46s] we discover what
[1372.46s - 1373.10s] our unique edge is.
[1373.10s - 1373.90s] Like we have an
[1373.90s - 1374.72s] idea of something
[1374.72s - 1375.44s] that we love,
[1375.48s - 1375.94s] that we want to
[1375.94s - 1376.48s] explore more.
[1376.56s - 1377.18s] Maybe we have the
[1377.18s - 1379.96s] idea to be
[1379.96s - 1381.02s] capitalistic with,
[1381.02s - 1383.30s] whatever the notion
[1383.30s - 1384.84s] is there, but there
[1384.84s - 1385.52s] are these deeper
[1385.52s - 1386.76s] seated programs that
[1386.76s - 1387.98s] we kind of have to
[1387.98s - 1389.40s] realize that we don't
[1389.40s - 1390.30s] have to live by.
[1390.74s - 1391.44s] No matter what
[1391.44s - 1392.22s] culture you're in,
[1393.96s - 1395.90s] we develop rules.
[1396.10s - 1397.20s] Rules is what I
[1397.20s - 1397.80s] coined in my book,
[1397.88s - 1398.28s] The Code of the
[1398.28s - 1398.88s] Extraordinary Mind.
[1398.94s - 1399.38s] It stands for
[1399.38s - 1400.30s] bullshit rules,
[1400.44s - 1400.64s] right?
[1400.66s - 1401.42s] We develop bullshit
[1401.42s - 1402.82s] rules about the
[1402.82s - 1403.56s] world around us.
[1404.10s - 1404.40s] And, you know,
[1404.72s - 1405.32s] one of my mentors
[1405.32s - 1406.00s] is Bob Proctor.
[1406.22s - 1407.76s] Bob was a dear
[1407.76s - 1409.28s] friend and very
[1409.28s - 1409.92s] sad that he died
[1409.92s - 1410.58s] in 2022.
[1410.58s - 1412.78s] And he created
[1412.78s - 1413.96s] a meditation that
[1413.96s - 1414.88s] he dedicated to
[1414.88s - 1414.96s] me.
[1415.04s - 1415.38s] It's called the
[1415.38s - 1416.20s] Abundance Meditation.
[1416.30s - 1416.84s] It's on YouTube.
[1416.96s - 1417.44s] Go listen to it.
[1417.46s - 1417.88s] It's amazing.
[1418.90s - 1419.42s] And one of the
[1419.42s - 1420.02s] things he says in
[1420.02s - 1420.64s] that meditation,
[1420.90s - 1421.54s] and it's in my
[1421.54s - 1422.22s] mind because I was
[1422.22s - 1423.78s] listening to it this
[1423.78s - 1424.30s] morning, is he
[1424.30s - 1425.76s] says, the greatest
[1425.76s - 1426.58s] illusion we have as
[1426.58s - 1428.46s] human beings is that
[1428.46s - 1430.74s] there is anything in
[1430.74s - 1432.82s] reality that is
[1432.82s - 1433.54s] outside our
[1433.54s - 1433.88s] control.
[1435.06s - 1435.80s] So what he's
[1435.80s - 1436.94s] saying is literally
[1436.94s - 1439.38s] all of reality is
[1439.38s - 1439.82s] within our

[1586.62s - 1587.22s] meditation this
[1587.22s - 1587.44s] morning.
[1587.76s - 1588.34s] I think if you

[1589.00s - 1589.66s] full abundance
[1589.66s - 1590.50s] meditation, he
[1590.50s - 1591.80s] describes it, but
[1591.80s - 1592.46s] I think what he's
[1592.46s - 1593.24s] really saying is
[1593.24s - 1594.20s] that it is a
[1594.20s - 1594.90s] delusion that you
[1594.90s - 1595.18s] don't have

[1598.44s - 1598.68s] saying.
[1599.82s - 1600.48s] Yeah, and the
[1600.48s - 1601.30s] realization that our

[1627.68s - 1628.78s] I know how big
[1628.78s - 1629.58s] intuition has been
[1629.58s - 1630.04s] for you.
[1630.58s - 1631.26s] I want to get your
[1631.26s - 1632.22s] perspective on this
[1632.22s - 1633.02s] because we're

[1644.68s - 1645.72s] manner.
[1646.04s - 1647.00s] So how do you

[1648.20s - 1648.86s] in your life?
[1648.94s - 1649.28s] How are you

[1650.28s - 1650.68s] it is?
[1651.54s - 1653.46s] Intuition is a

[1657.30s - 1657.86s] Let me explain
[1657.86s - 1658.14s] why.
[1658.96s - 1659.44s] A lot of people
[1659.44s - 1660.82s] think AI is this
[1660.82s - 1662.10s] machine in the
[1662.10s - 1663.70s] clouds, separate
[1663.70s - 1664.24s] from us.
[1664.46s - 1665.00s] It isn't.
[1665.60s - 1666.00s] You know what
[1666.00s - 1666.54s] AI is?
[1666.66s - 1668.50s] It's technology
[1668.50s - 1669.84s] taking the grand
[1669.84s - 1671.30s] accumulation of all
[1671.30s - 1672.72s] of human wisdom,
[1673.32s - 1675.04s] creativity, art,
[1675.56s - 1677.36s] knowledge, uniting
[1677.36s - 1677.60s] it.
[1677.72s - 1678.18s] It's literally
[1678.18s - 1679.14s] uniting our
[1679.14s - 1680.54s] brains and
[1680.54s - 1681.52s] creating a layer
[1681.52s - 1682.28s] on top of it
[1682.28s - 1684.66s] where all of us
[1684.66s - 1685.62s] have access to
[1685.62s - 1686.40s] the collective
[1686.40s - 1687.46s] creativity and
[1687.46s - 1688.12s] intelligence of
[1688.12s - 1688.56s] humanity.
[1689.84s - 1690.00s] Right?
[1690.14s - 1690.68s] AI literally
[1690.68s - 1691.28s] scraped the
[1691.28s - 1692.28s] internet, scraped
[1692.28s - 1693.00s] all of these
[1693.00s - 1694.52s] all books, all
[1694.52s - 1695.38s] put into large
[1695.38s - 1696.14s] language models
[1696.14s - 1697.80s] and allowed us
[1697.80s - 1699.48s] to now create a
[1699.48s - 1700.44s] poem, create an
[1700.44s - 1701.20s] art piece, create
[1701.20s - 1701.82s] music, it's
[1701.82s - 1702.58s] trained on our
[1702.58s - 1703.32s] collective work.
[1704.14s - 1706.86s] Now, I believe
[1706.86s - 1707.70s] that intuition is
[1707.70s - 1708.38s] something similar.
[1709.52s - 1710.98s] All of us, I
[1710.98s - 1711.30s] believe, are
[1711.30s - 1711.94s] deeply connected.
[1712.40s - 1714.90s] I don't think we
[1714.90s - 1715.60s] can explain that
[1715.60s - 1716.60s] scientifically yet
[1716.60s - 1718.10s] and maybe quantum
[1718.10s - 1718.86s] biology will give
[1718.86s - 1720.02s] us an answer, but
[1720.02s - 1720.84s] all human beings
[1720.84s - 1721.24s] are deeply
[1721.24s - 1721.72s] connected.
[1722.20s - 1723.10s] The closer you

[1853.86s - 1854.30s] this, which is
[1854.30s - 1854.70s] exciting.
[1855.26s - 1856.02s] And of course, we
[1856.02s - 1856.34s] don't have to
[1856.34s - 1856.98s] understand something
[1856.98s - 1857.70s] to use it, to

[1859.18s - 1859.54s] life.
[1860.14s - 1860.80s] And so when it
[1860.80s - 1861.50s] comes to intuition,
[1861.50s - 1862.32s] as you've
[1862.32s - 1864.36s] discovered it, what
[1864.36s - 1865.60s] have been a couple

[1869.02s - 1869.92s] intuition as it
[1869.92s - 1871.98s] can be your own
[1871.98s - 1872.72s] connection to that
[1872.72s - 1873.14s] source of

[1876.56s - 1877.48s] So I've had
[1877.48s - 1879.36s] intuitive insights
[1879.36s - 1880.80s] that have guided
[1880.80s - 1882.24s] me to producing
[1882.24s - 1883.46s] a talk or a

[1885.62s - 1886.46s] Just as this
[1886.46s - 1888.20s] insight.
[1889.10s - 1889.56s] But I've also
[1889.56s - 1890.12s] had intuitive
[1890.12s - 1891.26s] insights that
[1891.26s - 1892.42s] have saved my

[1893.78s - 1894.14s] And intuition
[1894.14s - 1894.68s] can come to
[1894.68s - 1895.22s] you in different
[1895.22s - 1895.58s] ways.
[1896.00s - 1896.60s] People feel it
[1896.60s - 1896.92s] in different

[1897.46s - 1897.98s] Clairvoyance
[1897.98s - 1898.36s] is when you

[1899.06s - 1899.54s] Clairaudience
[1899.54s - 1900.02s] is when you
[1900.02s - 1900.78s] hear something.
[1901.42s - 1901.90s] Clairsentience
[1901.90s - 1902.34s] is when you
[1902.34s - 1902.90s] feel it in your
[1902.90s - 1903.24s] body.
[1904.30s - 1904.98s] Clairsentience, I
[1904.98s - 1905.86s] think, is really
[1905.86s - 1906.30s] interesting.
[1906.54s - 1907.20s] You can be in a

[1908.38s - 1909.54s] meet someone and
[1909.54s - 1910.40s] you feel this
[1910.40s - 1911.38s] feeling in your
[1911.38s - 1912.30s] body and it's
[1912.30s - 1913.74s] like, no, no.
[1913.86s - 1914.12s] You know, it
[1914.12s - 1914.78s] sometimes happens
[1914.78s - 1916.00s] when you go on a
[1916.00s - 1916.58s] blind date or
[1916.58s - 1917.26s] something along those
[1917.26s - 1917.56s] lines.
[1918.00s - 1918.68s] I had an
[1918.68s - 1919.22s] experience of
[1919.22s - 1919.92s] Clairaudience that
[1919.92s - 1920.60s] saved my life.
[1921.24s - 1922.32s] So it was, must
[1922.32s - 1923.86s] be in 2007, 2008,
[1923.94s - 1924.42s] the Black Eyed
[1924.42s - 1925.50s] Peas song, My
[1925.50s - 1926.34s] Humps, had come
[1926.34s - 1926.56s] out.
[1927.24s - 1928.06s] And I love the
[1928.06s - 1928.78s] Black Eyed Peas, so
[1928.78s - 1929.38s] I was driving down
[1929.38s - 1930.90s] the road and the
[1930.90s - 1931.72s] song came up and I
[1931.72s - 1932.38s] was just paying
[1932.38s - 1933.16s] attention to the
[1933.16s - 1934.54s] lyrics and laughing
[1934.54s - 1935.60s] because it was so
[1935.60s - 1936.92s] cute, such my
[1936.92s - 1937.86s] humps, my naughty
[1937.86s - 1938.64s] little humps.
[1939.00s - 1939.94s] It was so awesome.
[1940.10s - 1941.38s] And so all of a
[1941.38s - 1942.68s] sudden, I heard a
[1942.68s - 1943.10s] voice.
[1943.76s - 1944.64s] This is wild, right?
[1944.66s - 1945.54s] I heard a voice like
[1945.54s - 1946.20s] there was someone in
[1946.20s - 1946.78s] the backseat of my
[1946.78s - 1947.56s] car saying, pay
[1947.56s - 1948.62s] attention to the
[1948.62s - 1948.78s] road.
[1950.18s - 1951.94s] And it brought my
[1951.94s - 1952.74s] mind off the song
[1952.74s - 1953.82s] back to the road
[1953.82s - 1955.32s] and just then a
[1955.32s - 1956.74s] truck hit a car,
[1957.26s - 1958.46s] the car flipped up,
[1959.08s - 1960.34s] landed in front of
[1960.34s - 1961.84s] me, and I had just
[1961.84s - 1962.34s] enough time to
[1962.34s - 1962.58s] break.
[1962.58s - 1964.10s] And that was
[1964.10s - 1965.28s] wild, right?
[1965.54s - 1966.96s] I possibly would
[1966.96s - 1967.78s] have hit that car
[1967.78s - 1969.12s] if I hadn't heard
[1969.12s - 1970.86s] that voice, but I
[1970.86s - 1971.74s] swear it felt like it
[1971.74s - 1972.26s] was coming from the
[1972.26s - 1972.66s] backseat.
[1972.98s - 1973.72s] There was no one in
[1973.72s - 1974.20s] the backseat.
[1974.82s - 1976.00s] So what voice was
[1976.00s - 1977.04s] that voice to this
[1977.04s - 1977.22s] day?
[1977.30s - 1978.64s] I don't know, but it
[1978.64s - 1979.30s] was a voice.
[1980.02s - 1981.30s] That is clairaudience,
[1981.54s - 1982.48s] a form of intuition.
[1983.54s - 1984.72s] It's so fascinating

The speaker shares personal experiences and insights about how intuition can guide and save lives. The text is rich in personal anecdotes and explanations of different types of intuition. The task is to identify powerful, standalone motivational quotes or messages that can be used in a motivational short video.

===INPUT CHUNK START===
[1984.72s - 1986.60s] to just look at
[1986.60s - 1988.36s] the research and
[1988.36s - 1989.42s] how much
[1989.42s - 1991.20s] information is
[1991.20s - 1991.92s] available to our
[1991.92s - 1992.74s] sensory experience
[1992.74s - 1993.28s] at any given
[1993.28s - 1994.06s] moment, and yet
[1994.06s - 1994.96s] what we're
[1994.96s - 1996.34s] consciously aware
[1996.34s - 1997.30s] of is a small,
[1997.40s - 1997.92s] small, less than
[1997.92s - 1998.92s] 1% fraction of
[1998.92s - 1999.76s] that for maybe
[1999.76s - 2000.88s] none other than
[2000.88s - 2001.86s] it would just be
[2001.86s - 2002.64s] simply overwhelming
[2002.64s - 2003.78s] to be perceiving
[2003.78s - 2004.54s] all that we have
[2004.54s - 2005.22s] access to or
[2005.22s - 2005.92s] connected to.
[2006.80s - 2007.74s] But the fact that
[2007.74s - 2008.30s] we are connected
[2008.30s - 2009.22s] to it allows us
[2009.22s - 2010.32s] to tune into
[2010.32s - 2010.66s] that.
[2011.08s - 2012.86s] And what do you
[2012.86s - 2013.24s] think is the
[2013.24s - 2014.16s] relationship to
[2014.16s - 2015.38s] intuition and
[2015.38s - 2017.16s] getting quiet and
[2017.16s - 2018.34s] feeling open
[2018.34s - 2019.56s] internally in that
[2019.56s - 2021.18s] sort of relaxed
[2021.18s - 2022.50s] state of mind
[2022.50s - 2023.94s] and how that
[2023.94s - 2025.20s] opens up your
[2025.20s - 2026.08s] intuitive capacities?
[2027.02s - 2027.50s] So studies in
[2027.50s - 2028.54s] intuition show
[2028.54s - 2030.26s] that when it
[2030.26s - 2031.00s] correlates with a
[2031.00s - 2031.60s] certain brainwave
[2031.60s - 2032.36s] state, that brainwave
[2032.36s - 2032.88s] state is called
[2032.88s - 2033.22s] theta.
[2033.98s - 2035.06s] So Dave Asprey,
[2035.22s - 2036.30s] the famous biohacker,
[2036.38s - 2037.06s] he has a facility
[2037.06s - 2038.32s] in Seattle called
[2038.32s - 2039.26s] 40 Years of Zen,
[2039.56s - 2040.44s] wonderful place,
[2040.56s - 2040.94s] and they use
[2040.94s - 2042.34s] biofeedback to
[2042.34s - 2043.14s] train your brain
[2043.14s - 2044.20s] to develop the
[2044.20s - 2044.92s] brainwave states
[2044.92s - 2045.60s] of monks,
[2046.24s - 2047.26s] Zen Roshi monks.
[2047.38s - 2047.70s] So they're
[2047.70s - 2048.90s] basically reversing
[2048.90s - 2050.18s] the brainwaves of
[2050.18s - 2050.90s] Zen Roshi monks
[2050.90s - 2051.32s] who have spent
[2051.32s - 2051.80s] decades in
[2051.80s - 2052.22s] meditation.
[2052.84s - 2053.30s] Now here's what
[2053.30s - 2053.72s] happens.
[2054.52s - 2055.04s] There's a particular
[2055.04s - 2055.78s] brainwave pattern.
[2056.58s - 2057.74s] So Zen Roshi monks,
[2057.96s - 2058.56s] what is unique about
[2058.56s - 2059.18s] their brain is they
[2059.18s - 2059.96s] have high alpha
[2059.96s - 2060.98s] amplitude, alpha
[2060.98s - 2062.24s] as a wave, high
[2062.24s - 2063.00s] amplitudes of the
[2063.00s - 2063.80s] wave as opposed to
[2063.80s - 2064.70s] smaller amplitudes,
[2064.92s - 2065.58s] and they have a
[2065.58s - 2066.16s] left-right brain
[2066.16s - 2066.72s] coherence.
[2067.50s - 2069.34s] Now they use
[2069.34s - 2070.38s] biofeedback to
[2070.38s - 2071.02s] put you in that
[2071.02s - 2071.72s] brainwave state.
[2072.38s - 2073.16s] And after you learn
[2073.16s - 2074.04s] to be able to stay
[2074.04s - 2075.08s] awake at alpha,
[2076.08s - 2077.36s] like meditation,
[2077.88s - 2078.40s] they take you
[2078.40s - 2079.32s] deeper to what
[2079.32s - 2080.18s] is called theta.
[2080.82s - 2081.50s] Theta is really
[2081.50s - 2081.90s] interesting.
[2082.10s - 2083.02s] Theta is where,
[2083.36s - 2083.62s] you know, when
[2083.62s - 2084.10s] you're meditating
[2084.10s - 2084.60s] and your head
[2084.60s - 2085.20s] starts nodding
[2085.20s - 2085.66s] like that,
[2086.08s - 2086.48s] you're dipping
[2086.48s - 2086.98s] into theta.
[2087.20s - 2087.72s] And often you'll
[2087.72s - 2088.30s] see dreams.
[2089.06s - 2089.92s] Theta is where
[2089.92s - 2090.86s] intuition lies.
[2091.68s - 2092.66s] So you can
[2092.66s - 2093.54s] train yourself to
[2093.54s - 2094.28s] stay awake at
[2094.28s - 2094.54s] theta.
[2095.14s - 2095.86s] And when you go
[2095.86s - 2097.46s] into theta and
[2097.46s - 2099.60s] you're awake,
[2100.32s - 2100.98s] you're tapping
[2100.98s - 2101.60s] into something,
[2104.04s - 2104.24s] insights,
[2104.52s - 2105.12s] ideas,
[2105.46s - 2106.06s] all of this
[2106.06s - 2106.76s] stuff starts
[2106.76s - 2107.84s] flowing out.
[2108.84s - 2109.94s] That is
[2109.94s - 2110.30s] intuition.
[2110.50s - 2111.00s] That's how it
[2111.00s - 2111.46s] connects to
[2111.46s - 2111.98s] brainwaves.
[2112.52s - 2112.84s] And I was,
[2113.06s - 2113.50s] I remember being
[2113.50s - 2114.50s] on Impact Theory,
[2114.64s - 2115.36s] Tom Bilyeu's show,
[2115.88s - 2116.18s] and we were
[2116.18s - 2116.56s] talking about
[2116.56s - 2117.04s] meditation,
[2117.20s - 2117.92s] and Tom is a

===REASONING STEPS===
Thought:
The chunk discusses the relationship between intuition and brainwave states, particularly focusing on the theta state. The text is dense with scientific and technical details about how the brain functions and how to train it to achieve specific states. The overall context is about the science of intuition and how to harness it.

The task is to extract motivational text that is inspiring, actionable, and can stand alone as a motivational short. Given the context, I am looking for quotes or statements that provide insights into personal growth, motivation, or actionable advice. The text should be concise, impactful, and memorable.

Code:
```py
text = "[2089.92s - 2090.86s] Theta is where intuition lies. [2091.68s - 2092.66s] So you can train yourself to stay awake at theta. [2093.54s - 2094.28s] And when you go into theta and you're awake, you're tapping into something, [2095.14s - 2095.86s] insights, [2095.86s - 2097.46s] ideas, [2097.46s - 2099.60s] all of this stuff starts flowing out. [2100.32s - 2100.98s] That is intuition. [2100.98s - 2101.60s] That's how it connects to brainwaves."
