New text saved:New text saved:[260.08s - 268.08s] So you got to find that person who has a good balance between discipline and kind of a wild freedom creativity that they can make adjustments.

New text saved:New text saved:[269.08s - 277.14s] It's interesting to think that more focus or more efficiency isn't always the solution to everything.

New text saved:[601.42s - 619.71s] One of the things that I've been thinking about a lot recently is whether it's possible to take too much responsibility or too much ownership where you start to believe that you're at fault or you're accountable for things and blame yourself too frequently blame yourself too much.

New text saved:New text saved:[986.72s - 991.72s] 'Discipline equals freedom'

New text saved:New text saved:[1135.52s - 1141.52s] And if you don't work hard for something you're not going to get an outcome that's really worth much.

New text saved:New text saved:[1660.63s - 1667.63s] And if you curl up into a ball and complain about it, that's not going to help you.

New text saved:New text saved:[1887.37s - 1915.91s] And there's a part of that that makes me think about good is an active philosophy, right? It's actively saying something happens. I'm going to lean into it. I'm going to be forward motion, right? And then the backup that you seem to have behind that as well is look at all of the things that I've dealt with before. Look at all of the effectiveness that I've come through with previously.

New text saved:New text saved:[1996.57s - 1999.67s] 'Discipline is infinitely more important.'

New text saved:New text saved:[1999.67s - 2002.67s] So no matter how you feel, get up and do what you're supposed to do.

New text saved:New text saved:[2028.71s - 2035.93s] He said that courage or bravery, I think is actually what he was talking about. It's an emotion that you can't fake. If you fake bravery when you're terrified, that is bravery.

New text saved:New text saved:[2065.09s - 2067.09s] Just shut up and go do what you're supposed to do.

New text saved:New text saved:[2127.21s - 2129.34s] Discipline equals freedom.

New text saved:New text saved:[2161.53s - 2166.53s] Just do the thing, man.

New text saved:New text saved:[2201.79s - 2214.92s] I think courage has to have some kind of risk involved. And then, yes, I agree with Sam Harris when he pointed out that if you're acting, if you're doing the thing, then that's courage. No matter how you feel inside your little brain.#

New text saved:New text saved:[2295.13s - 2310.77s] Courage is very hard to find when life gets comfortable for people. How can they stop their bravery from eroding when times are easy? Do something that's hard and do it every day.

New text saved:New text saved:[4089.72s - 4098.33s] wish them luck walk away and don't look back and you're still going to get those emotions those things are still going to hit you but walk away and don't look back

New text saved:New text saved:[4833.26s - 4839.82s] that's again a great reason to get out there and train it's kind of like a superpower

New text saved:New text saved:[5734.27s - 5745.15s] 'leadership is a skill just like guitar is a skill. there's moves that are just like playing chords and people don't understand that.'

New text saved:New text saved:[5897.13s - 5903.56s] 'tomorrow is not necessarily promised to us and that things can end pretty quickly'

New text saved:New text saved:[5951.61s - 5964.24s] to think oh don't worry i got all the time in the world because i know i don't and i'm lucky to be here and i'm gonna try and live in a way that will at least do justice for my friends that aren't here

New text saved:New text saved:[6023.61s - 6030.40s] 'because of what this person did for me while they were alive now that they've passed look at how much more i'm living look at i mean is there any better tribute to somebody definitely makes you appreciate the sunsets more'

New text saved:New text saved:[6096.24s - 6101.34s] but there is a point at which you become kind of aware of your own mortality

New text saved:New text saved:[7167.29s - 7175.07s] and now is one of the things that's at the front of my mind that when you have somebody that goes on operation and serves it's not just them that pay the price and it's not just them and the support units that are out there and the drivers and the people on the ground and the fixes and the translators and stuff there's a literal army of people back home as well

New text saved:New text saved:[7743.07s - 7761.39s] 'you have to look for what what's the trade-off going to be i'm going to win a little bit here i'm going to lose a little bit there but overall it's going to move me in the right direction i think it's a good thing to understand as opposed to going through life thinking that you're going to find a 100 percent solution because it's not going to exist so you're going to have to make trade-offs in life'

New text saved:New text saved:[7781.40s - 7792.52s] 'regrets were a bug not a feature of life i didn't realize that they were baked into the literal fabric of how we exist'

New text saved:[7818.46s - 7826.16s] one of the things that you need to consider is which of these regrets can i live with and which of these regrets can i not live with and that there's no solutions only trade-offs

New text saved:New text saved:[8500.09s - 8504.97s] only you can do your podcast only i can do my podcast precisely only you can write your books

New text saved:New text saved:[8539.42s - 8544.78s] do not outsource the thing that drives the revenue the thing that drives the revenue must be protected at all costs

New text saved:New text saved:[8858.17s - 8895.02s] you can't change it to one time and now you can defend yourself or you can't pick up a guitar

New text saved:New text saved:[9063.52s - 9076.72s] you have to lead your boss in that right direction you have to lead your peers in the right direction you have to lead your family in the right direction you have to even if you're you by leading your family that means putting your ego in check and listening to what your kids have to say

New text saved:New text saved:[265.44s - 268.44s] "I want to know how to live."

New text saved:New text saved:[618.55s - 632.55s] Knowledge and skills are like gold, a currency you will transform into something more valuable than you can imagine.

New text saved:New text saved:[1182.53s - 1188.93s] 'So having that sense that you want to be a writer, that you want to make films, that you want to start a particular kind of business if you're interested in technology, creates a framework in your brain that kind of changes how you make decisions.'

New text saved:New text saved:[1221.97s - 1234.45s] That's beautiful. And I agree. Do not be the court cynic. The ability to express wonder and

New text saved:New text saved:[1310.18s - 1316.02s] You take everything for granted, but you don't realize that to be alive, the odds against you being Chris Williamson are absolutely astronomical to be around with all this technology where we were as humans 20,000 years ago. Something you can't even begin to fathom.

New text saved:[1750.53s - 1755.89s] It means you can hold two thoughts in your head at the same time, two thoughts that apparently contradict each other, but you can entertain them and not grasp.

New text saved:[1856.48s - 1870.66s] And I like the cleanness of a game. It's like you do this and you can win it. But there's also a psychological element in it.

New text saved:New text saved:[2134.45s - 2140.13s] Yep, correct. So this is the sort of odd, and this is the really important point. Never let others define it for you. And when you are vulnerable, you will be attacked on all sides.

New text saved:New text saved:[2145.49s - 2151.25s] Because as it's going up, it does, it precedes you. It continues to do work for you exponentially, growing and growing. But when you're starting to go down, even your best work will sometimes be derogated to be worse than it is.

New text saved:New text saved:[2165.60s - 2171.36s] Yeah, credibility is the one thing that you should never sell because you cannot buy it back. There is no return policy on your credibility.

New text saved:New text saved:[2198.83s - 2205.79s] Everything you do is reflected through the social world, right? Nothing is in isolation.

New text saved:New text saved:[2448.90s - 2452.90s] So reputation also has to have a consistency, a core to it, a soul that binds it all together.
