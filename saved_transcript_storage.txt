[29.69s - 34.61s] Some of the greatest ideas have flown under your radar without you noticing because the founder didn't do it justice
[45.58s - 50.02s] But our communication skills as it relates to how the world perceives us and it's both the importance
[54.74s - 60.54s] It's it's not as simple it's both because if I have great showmanship and then when it comes to doing sleight of hand
[63.82s - 67.90s] The people that I've been able to help the most in my career so far the people who are technically
[68.46s - 76.46s] So amazing at what they do and they've been hidden away in the back office as a technician and then bloody Brad always gets the promotion
[82.42s - 84.42s] Right, and it's because Brad talks better

[567.10s - 571.18s] Once we investigated the validity of his belief that he's fundamentally bad, he realized it's not a truth.
[571.18s - 585.55s] This led to a profound transformation, bringing joy and relief to him and the audience.









scarcity is like where people have this misnomer that there isn't enough as it relates to the
material world, right? So there's a relationship to ourselves, there's a relationship to others,
and there's a relationship to the material world. And so they tend to be the default factory settings
of the subconscious that we look through. Something wrong with me, I'm not fundamentally
loved and accepted by society, and I don't have enough. And then it's like slap on the ass and
go figure it out, have fun. Become who you think you should be as a compensation for your inadequacy,
do whatever you have to as a strategy to win love and favor from your fellow species,
and then accumulate as much as you can to compensate for the scarcity. And those three
right there, you start to see the idiosyncrasies that people deal with, right? People are exhausted,
they are living in a pretense, they're trying to be who they think they should be in order to
be loved and accepted. They are doing whatever they can as a strategy to compensate for their
own shortcomings, whether they work harder, they become people pleases perfectionists.
The social media game is obviously where this is replete with the attempts to, through filters and
posters and positions and lights to look good. And then the hoarding mentality that it is to be
human, the holding onto things as though anything exogenous to us has any value at all, it just
doesn't. So when you really start to see that it's like, holy shit, no wonder people are just sick





[1592.93s - 1598.45s] world that we see, which is control, manipulation, domination, because people are trying to manipulate
[1598.45s - 1603.89s] the things around them under the illusion that that's what's going to garner my greater sense of joy.
[1604.96s - 1609.52s] But that's not how it works. I mean, talk to a billionaire, right? Like I've worked with,
[1609.52s - 1613.60s] I don't know, a couple of dozen of them. They don't have white light shooting out their genitals,
[1613.60s - 1618.64s] and they're not like loving life, right? They didn't crack the code. They're still usually
[1618.64s - 1623.12s] trying to accumulate more because that's where they're still caught in the same rat race as most
[1623.12s - 1630.83s] people that it's out there somewhere. So I think the overlap is good to see. The cascade of one to
[1630.91s - 1635.55s] the next is good to see. But really, it's the fundamentals of what is it we're up against.
[1636.11s - 1641.23s] That's the thing to see is that, you know, as I said earlier, albeit in that sort of rapid
[1641.23s - 1646.83s] download, we are what we're looking for. It's just we're looking through a lens of illusion that


[1764.32s - 1768.16s] doing it from a place of obligation, suffering, a feeling of lack, I'm trying to get away from 
[1768.16s - 1771.12s] something I'm trying to fix or am I doing it for the pure joy of creation and being alive?

[1853.76s - 1860.80s] self-improvement is a project of the divided self. It is like a dog chase its own tail,
[1862.16s - 1868.08s] failing to recognize that we are the source of that which we seek like you're referring to.

[1899.52s - 1904.00s] predominant limiting belief holding us back without our awareness right now?


[2052.03s - 2063.23s] "There's one of my more favorite quotes. I say, you know, it's either life threatening or it's ego threatening. For the most part, hopefully most people's lives, there isn't much life threatening ever, you know, occasionally. But for the most part, it's all your own perspective that's being threatened."





[2215.81s - 2221.33s] hell to get there, right? And so I've definitely been through hell.


New text saved:[2579.47s - 2584.35s] Because my mind just would not stop. It is an addiction, right? When we come from that place of suffering.

New text saved:[2644.16s - 2653.20s] And so we got this incredible piece of equipment that's always trying to calculate what's going to happen for its own self preservation, which, you know, which is handy, we all want to stick around.
[2658.08s - 2662.24s] But I realized it's futile, because it doesn't matter how much you sit and try and think about what's going to happen, the best you can speculate.
[2669.68s - 2678.48s] So that's where that pattern to me got revealed. And the truth was just so self evident that it was undeniable. And I never looked back,

New text saved:[2693.92s - 2789.84s] of life is uncertainty. But then secondly, for the first time in my life, I was totally okay with it.
And that was peace. That to me was true success. There was nothing more to figure out. There was nothing to control. There was nothing to manipulate or try and win or hold. It was, it was complete surrender. And because I know you love physics and the sort of the subtler bodies of this,
this paradigm we're in. What was so profound for me is within 15 minutes of me having that revelation, my phone rings and at this point it was a landline showing my age. But I pick it up and it's her. And I haven't spoken to her for about six weeks. And the last time I spoke to her, I'm the desperate one, like trying to get her back, right? And now she's crying, saying, I miss you so much, I want to come back. I mean, I get tingles now, right? Because what I got at that moment was in physics entanglement theory, right? But the unification of everything. And she was literally on the other side of the planet. She couldn't physically have been further. She was in New Zealand, right? And this isn't a knowing, right? This is an energetic resonance that I would assert at that moment I had become available for the first time in my life. Because I wasn't available. Most people in relationships aren't available. I know that's a bold statement to make. But because you're fighting your own feelings of constraint, and then your partner is the mirror for hopefully for those things to obviously get transmuted. But at that moment, I no longer had anything to prove.

New text saved:[2795.20s - 2847.47s] I didn't need to hold on to her. I understood what love was. I recognized what freedom was. And albeit, of course, over the last two plus decades, you know, there's been moments where I've still tried to figure shit out. But it wasn't from a place of fear. It wasn't from a place of worry. It wasn't from a place of desperation. So that was the insight that could not be unseen. Those moments where you see the interconnection of life is such a trip and a reminder of these chords that we really do create with people and how the energies we hold and beliefs are, when they're when they're collapsed, immediately in real time, you get that call. Like that's just proof right there of the energy collapsing, but then also how it's connected with other people.

New text saved:[2935.57s - 2959.65s] 'To me, it's such an important reminder of what is love and the mirrors that relationships serve '
[2959.65s - 2965.81s] 'in our life and how we're constantly bringing in our past history with us into every dynamic and '
[2965.81s - 2973.47s] 'actually painfully. The realization is that we're relating to people through our own perspective '
[2973.47s - 2978.27s] 'of them and who we want them to be and not actually them. Now, looking back on that, '
[2978.27s - 2984.74s] 'what does that reveal to you about what it means to actually relate to people '
[2984.74s - 2991.81s] 'from a true place of love without attachment of who we need them to be for us?'

New text saved:[3054.67s - 3090.53s] To get someone's reality, and it doesn't mean you have to agree with it, condone with it, or go by whatever they're asking of you, but to really get their reality, to me, is the greatest gift of love you can afford somebody. And I got it. I was like, holy shit, I just wanted to be with her. No agenda, no intention, no Peter Crone in the way, no fear of loss, no little boy that needed reassuring, none of that. And there's something so beautiful about it, because it's almost like by virtue of truly being with another being, human, you get to see

New text saved:[3171.46s - 3184.88s] And that to me is true intimacy. That's the beautiful, pure line of connection that is 
always there underneath the static that is our egos trying to be right or connect.

New text saved:[3236.22s - 3249.02s] "So it's beautiful because I think it also appeals to the fact that again, without sounding too poetic, that our nature is to love. And so when we see a part of us that's not doing that, it hurts because we're in denial of our true self. It's like we're disappointed in who we know we are, you know, who we can be."

New text saved:[3267.50s - 3277.66s] "And that's, but it's such a magical mechanism to discover more love in this case of self-love, right? So compassion to self of like, oh, even though I was playing the role of the perfect boyfriend, which was my way of strategizing to not lose something that was of value to me, it was so well intended and innocent, you know, even to the point where sometimes okay, there's really horrific things that happen in relationships that I don't condone."

New text saved:[3286.54s - 3376.18s] "I mean, people go through horrible forms of harm and abuse. But, you know, underneath it all, 
[3291.82s - 3299.90s] I really feel there's just a little boy or a little girl that just wants to connect. 
[3299.90s - 3306.06s] You know, I always talk about these three qualities I feel every human being wants, 
[3307.57s - 3318.29s] which is to be seen, heard and held. And in the absence of the idea of our self, we get to 
[3318.29s - 3321.09s] join and union there, which ironically is not to join, but really to reveal, right? Like, 
[3323.89s - 3329.33s] it's really just the dissolution process again, right? It's the revelation of the fact 
[3329.33s - 3337.97s] that there is nothing but love and unity. But we have this sort of preconceived idea 
[3337.97s - 3342.29s] that has us think that we're in this dangerous world where we have to present 
[3342.85s - 3348.50s] ourselves in a way so that we get loved and accepted. And it's so convoluted and exhausting. 
[3349.70s - 3355.38s] And in the absence of all of that, you just get to truly be with another human. 
[3355.38s - 3359.54s] And there's something inherently like a candle in a dark room that illuminates wherever it goes, 
[3360.18s - 3365.06s] a presence of love, somebody who has realized themselves as that nature, 
[3365.78s - 3370.42s] where they become an invitation for everybody around them to feel seen, heard and held. 
[3370.42s - 3376.18s] And I just find it so amazing that in the embodiment of that, you become a walking 
[3376.18s - 3376.18s] invitation to that energy. And it's wild what unravels in front of that presence that is you."

New text saved:[3426.69s - 3431.33s] 'It's allowing someone to be fully who they are in this moment, 
knowing that everything's in constant flux anyway.'

New text saved:[3500.24s - 3516.24s] "People feel the presence of safety where there is no judgment, there is listening, there is the ability to hear what they're saying and repeat it back so they know that they can trust that you're paying attention, that you care, all of these things."

New text saved:[3606.91s - 3612.11s] "you being a presence who really truly listens is the most invaluable thing we can do in life,
[3613.70s - 3618.66s] you know, and both for ourselves and others, because to the degree we're also truly listening
[3618.66s - 3624.18s] to others when we're in the presence of them, we can be a catalyst for their change,
[3628.98s - 3634.26s] but also we can become more aware of the subtleties within our own psyche, you know"

New text saved:[3672.80s - 3679.36s] "I mean, only to reiterate what I said, which I think is the greatest gift we can afford ourselves 
[3679.92s - 3687.20s] and the person we're listening to, right? Because it's truly reciprocated in the way that 
[3687.20s - 3693.12s] I step aside the idea of myself that has any agenda, has any concern about how I occur to you, 
[3693.12s - 3698.08s] like that I want to look, you know, favorable, good, loved, cool, whatever it is, like that all 
[3698.08s - 3706.32s] of that's put to one side. And I really get to just be with you and to hear what's going on 
[3706.32s - 3712.48s] without any judgment. It really is the demonstration of generosity in both directions, 
[3712.48s - 3716.80s] right? I'm going to hold space for you in a way that is generous, but you're going to, 
[3716.80s - 3722.00s] for that reason, feel safe enough that you can express yourself fully, 
[3722.00s - 3728.88s] vulnerably, without any fear of judgment. And so that's equally a form of generosity, right?

New text saved:[3794.27s - 3807.34s] "I don't trust any romantic relationship that hasn't been to the edge of annihilation. You know, and it really hit me as like, there's so much beauty in that, right? Like, because if everything has been so above, you know, the world of drama and, and heartache and suffering, because you kept it all together, that's just not real. It's just not human, right? It's like, you want to get into the dirt of a relationship, you know, really feel what it is to be fully exposed. Because as scary as that is, and as, as embarrassing as that can be, like, that's, that's to relate. You know, it's, otherwise it's all just facade and everything's like, you know, it's just, what is that? Maybe it's step for wives or whatever. It's like, everything's just perfect, you know, and it's, it's not."

New text saved:[3847.86s - 3852.82s] that paraphrasing says, we are alive to the degree in which we are willing to be annihilated,
[3853.30s - 3857.54s] which goes hand in hand with that, you know? And when we go back to like, how beautiful this
[3857.54s - 3862.42s] life is and what a gift it means and what it really means to be human, which is to move beyond
[3862.42s - 3867.70s] the limitations that nature has set upon, you know, all other life, you know, and animal and,
[3869.30s - 3873.06s] and plant life where we can go beyond our limitation of just survival.
[3874.66s - 3880.74s] And yet when we're in the energy of reactivity and reaction from these beliefs and perspectives,
[3881.38s - 3887.06s] we are literally not living our life in a way, you know, which is painful to see, but then again,
[3888.40s - 3893.92s] is also how this realm is sort of set up, you know? Yeah. Yeah. That's the self-preservation
[3893.92s - 3898.16s] lens, right? That's the survival instinct. It's where everything is perceived as a threat,
[3898.16s - 3901.76s] which again, if you can just default to, even if it's the one thing you remember from this, it's,
[3901.76s - 3906.08s] if it's not life threatening, it's just ego threatening. And if it's ego threatening,
[3906.08s - 3910.72s] that's a gift, right? Because on the other side of that, there's freedom waiting to be discovered.

New text saved:[3996.34s - 4008.10s] "Like even this conversation to me sits in the realm of fascination. People tuning in right now hoping, you know, that they are going to garner some insight, some inspiration that they wouldn't have known otherwise. Like that's the exploration that it is to be human."

New text saved:[4101.09s - 4105.25s] the more we tend to think we know shit, which ironically is a form of decay, right? Because you've lost that fascination, that exploration, that adventure.

New text saved:[4137.33s - 4150.53s] to me the feeling of aliveness that we see in children. That to me is the vitality that is
[4150.53s - 4156.37s] often lost when people start to know what's often not possible anymore, right? It's the loss of
[4157.17s - 4163.25s] the imagination because you've got one too many forms of evidence as to why something's not going
[4163.25s - 4167.65s] to work anymore.

New text saved:[4181.09s - 4186.91s] which was it's just sheer fucking pure possibility.

New text saved:[4193.39s - 4198.83s] It has to be because it has no ground to stand on. There's no actual
[4198.83s - 4205.31s] evidence other than the story.

New text saved:[4211.39s - 4216.59s] we're going to seek the evidence
[4216.59s - 4222.51s] to keep alive the illusion of ourselves because it's a pretense. It's made up.

New text saved:[4292.30s - 4300.30s] "There's no greater addiction than one's idea of oneself, right? That's the ultimate addiction."
[4300.30s - 4306.14s] "It's not the substance. It's not the behavior. It's the feeling of inadequacy and security or"
[4306.14s - 4311.34s] "scarcity. We're addicted to that because that's where we have become so familiar to ourselves."

New text saved:[4474.98s - 4524.75s] 'And that's where the absence of addiction occurs because the addiction is to the identity.'

New text saved:[4539.33s - 4545.09s] "But he fulfilled on that because he believed it to the degree that he was able to actually manifest it."

New text saved:[4557.71s - 4563.55s] "So that's the power of magic. This is why I love words and abracadabra as I speak so I create."

New text saved:[4568.75s - 4574.11s] "But we get to play with co-create in this dimension where we're all artists in the form, the medium in which we get to express ourselves and create these masterpieces for good or bad is through vibration and words."

New text saved:[4592.78s - 4598.62s] "And you discover the unique creative pulse that lives within you that is like that one of the eight billion faces on the diamond."

New text saved:[4676.06s - 4688.54s] 'A general come down as if all the good things one had vainly strained after in the heights were 
awaiting one in the depths.'

New text saved:[4769.22s - 4776.72s] "That's the exhaustion. No, abundance is. So it reveals itself in the absence of the idea of me as somebody who doesn't deserve it, doesn't know how to get it, has never had it. Money grows on trees, you know, whatever it is, or doesn't grow on trees, you know, like whatever people have as a form of programming, which is the obstacle to the richness of all of these qualities and characteristics that are already there."

New text saved:[4823.12s - 4839.78s] You cannot be healthy. No matter what you buy, hyperbaric cryogenic chambers, red lights, all the peptides in the fucking world, unless you free your mind, you have to do that first if you want to access vitality.

New text saved:[4883.30s - 4976.91s] see the illusion of how you've delineated yourself as some form of limitation in any arena,
[4889.22s - 4900.58s] your worth, you know, your capacity to love or be love, your value, your safety, whatever it is,
[4900.58s - 4914.82s] when all of that's gone, all of these qualities emerge because they've always been there. So for
[4914.82s - 4924.10s] this girl, she really appreciated this woman saying, oh my God, I never looked at it like that.
[4924.10s - 4938.02s] You're right. If I'm trying to create abundance, I'm saying one, I don't have it. So then my form
[4938.02s - 4948.42s] of resistance to life right now is creating suffering. I'm creating time, right? Because it's
[4948.42s - 4957.47s] mean something I have to do. That's the whole world of manifestation has encumbered upon me
[4957.47s - 4968.43s] to do something to get what I want, which creates time, which creates stress. I'm not where I want
[4968.43s - 4976.91s] to be. That creates urgency versus no, it's all there. And in the absence of me, it becomes
revealed effortlessly. And my work, there's three main qualities that I always see. Freedom, that's
as you know, my main product, because it's the freedom from the idea of oneself, which is really
relative in terms of time to history. We're letting go of that which has been, which has created the
idea of myself, which is illusory. So it's freedom from everything that is my baggage,
which immediately instantaneously at the same time gives an experience of newfound love
for what is myself, my life, my family, my circumstances, even if they're not ideal.
And simultaneously, that's the present state. As it relates to my future, I see nothing but pure
possibility. It's so well said, man, so well articulated. And I really, it's so interesting

New text saved:[4976.91s - 4982.75s] that paradox of striving for something that can only be recognized in the absence of striving.
[4982.91s - 4988.27s] Like we can never become free. We can only be free. Exactly. We can never become happy. We can
[4988.27s - 4994.99s] only be happy. It is an interesting paradox because even like for those that want to take
[4994.99s - 5003.15s] up the practice of meditation has beautiful benefits. And yet, to take up a practice that
[5003.15s - 5007.87s] you are saying is going to one day lead to freedom is almost reinforcing the shackles and chains of
[5007.87s - 5014.03s] you not being and recognizing that state in the current present tense. So it is both yes and
[5014.03s - 5022.03s] like we do live in this realm of duality and yet it's also we are, we can recognize the non-dual
[5022.03s - 5026.51s] state of our being. And that's the compassion part, right? Because to begin with my self-righteousness
[5026.51s - 5030.83s] when I saw this was like it was so self-evident. I was like the smartest guy in the room all of a
[5030.83s - 5035.07s] sudden, right? I had all the answers until I realized, no, that denied the fact that I previously
[5035.07s - 5039.55s] didn't, right? So I wasn't making space for compassion. So I tell people there's always
[5039.55s - 5043.87s] somewhere to get to until you realize there isn't. And they're both appropriate, right?
[5043.87s - 5046.83s] Because as long as you think there's someone to get to, that's where you currently at.
[5047.76s - 5051.44s] And you can't force not getting somewhere because that would be the ego still trying to do it,
[5051.44s - 5055.68s] you know, to look good in terms of like being spiritual or whatever. It's like, oh no, no,
[5055.68s - 5060.96s] kumbaya and I fucking meditate and I'm vegan or whatever. You know, that could be the ego's way
[5060.96s - 5065.92s] of just like trying to still garner love that that person never felt as a child. It's still

New text saved:[5130.22s - 5147.25s] "Jack Nicklaus, to me, still had one of the greatest quotes as it relates to accessing performance, which is he said, one of the most important parts of winning is being okay losing. He didn't say I want to lose. He didn't say that I wouldn't be upset if I lose, but he's okay with it. And so the irony is as soon as we make space for the things that we don't want, they no longer impede what we do want. Because we've incorporated that."

New text saved:[5168.88s - 5179.36s] So you really start to just recognize what it is to be a big enough human being that you're allowing for what it is to be a human being, which is to fuck up.

New text saved:[5326.93s - 5338.14s] And I think in hopefully the service, everybody who's tuning in, me sharing a little bit more of my own personal journey and I guess

New text saved:[5385.74s - 5389.26s] And I think this is a really big theme right now. And I see it more and more and the more
[5389.26s - 5394.94s] that I have awareness of it, you know, in myself. And I would say I had this conversation with this
[5394.94s - 5399.02s] guy, Daniel Schmachtenberger, who's a friend, and I would love to introduce you to him, just
[5399.02s - 5405.42s] incredible human being, but probably like about a year ago. And it was like a deep three hour late
[5405.42s - 5415.17s] night conversation that just like super awe inspiring. And I left with this deepening of
[5415.17s - 5421.33s] wanting to serve from the heart and in noticing the part of myself that has gotten caught up in
[5421.33s - 5427.89s] the identification with being spiritual. Right. And I had this sort of, and you're my friend,
[5427.89s - 5431.41s] so you can, you know, you've, you know, I mean, you can, you know, see patterns and different
[5431.41s - 5438.29s] things. So I'm curious to see what you pick up as I continue speaking here.

New text saved:[5456.75s - 5461.63s] I'm tired of spending energy upholding a persona that desires to be perceived as spiritual.

New text saved:[5629.31s - 5638.02s] The part of me that, you know, like the guru, the, the, the enlightened

New text saved:[5767.86s - 5771.70s] I think, for you, that spiritual facade, I think, like it reinforces the rigidity of trying to get shit right and look a certain way versus just being more childlike. And that means also, again, I'm jumping around here, but you'll keep track. I remember a girlfriend said, you know, she hadn't been to yoga for years. And so she's practicing a lot at home before she goes to class. I'm like, wait, what? She's like, well, yeah, it's kind of embarrassing. I'm like, do you even hear what you're saying? I mean, that's the opposite of fucking yoga. I mean, you're so disconnected. It's like, whereas a kid, like they love trying to balance on one leg and they're falling over and laughing, like they don't have to get it perfect, right? It's so that's where I think for you, just recognizing with compassion again, that yes, you got the look, you've got the brand.

New text saved:[5905.44s - 5926.00s] I'm as fallible, as imperfect, as available to contribution as you are. I might have a fancier way of articulating it and be a little bit more eloquent with language. But as it relates to like the heartfelt, like human flaws, I'm with you, you know.
[5931.92s - 5938.96s] And yeah, it's, it's human, you know.
[5945.90s - 5950.14s] My athletes, my guy who became the MVP, he was trying to be the perfect baseball. You can't do it.
[5955.82s - 5961.10s] Just that would be the addiction that would be your downfall, right? Because you can't sustain it.
[5966.38s - 5975.98s] I'm fucking dying of being spiritual. That's that's that's what like how how it makes sense to verbalize it now because I look back at even, you know, because right now we're kind of going through

New text saved:[6022.35s - 6038.27s] "the messy parts of myself it's okay like to not be seen a certain way like and I really had a deepening of like the the experiential like feeling in my body like a lot of those qualities we mentioned earlier"

New text saved:[6095.25s - 6102.99s] it's much more relatable which is beautiful because that's love right it's when someone's
[6102.99s - 6107.55s] becoming too perfect because of a persona that they're trying to create or portray they're not
[6107.55s - 6114.59s] actually attainable like you can't you can't connect with someone

New text saved:[6312.43s - 6316.91s] "often when I work with corporations I say good leaders don't make people wrong they make them better"

New text saved:[6321.15s - 6326.35s] "it's making space for the fact that we're all fucked up right that to me is real love"

New text saved:[6338.78s - 6345.02s] "can you find enough love for that part of you that's self-love that we're all imperfect"

New text saved:[6417.98s - 6426.94s] "people say they don't have the life they want they don't have the results they want they don't have the body they want invariably as a very practical reflection they just lack discipline"

New text saved:[6444.34s - 6533.71s] "from the smile it resonates right so one of the things that I find so admirable about you that 

[6449.22s - 6466.90s] you've inspired me with and many is your discipline but I think your discipline has become you know 

[6466.90s - 6496.99s] your own sort of self-created prison right where you've become so attached to it that you've lost 

[6496.99s - 6516.35s] the the flexibility of what it is to be flawed and to be human so I would invite you to to just 

[6516.35s - 6533.71s] expand your understanding of discipline which is to incorporate um what it is just to be 

[6520.43s - 6533.71s] it's all okay"

New text saved:[6571.54s - 6630.02s] "Palpable shift and it's a commitment out of out of love versus fear like what I see in you and so many people even who are very disciplined is that they're being driven by an underlying energy of fear right then I got to get it right it's about how I care to people it's about being the good boy not upsetting parents like filling the blank of whatever it is that we feel we have to do and it has that energy of must need which is a resistant energy versus it's a choice it's out of pure joy and exploration it's it's out of the sheer like love of being alive to have the feelings to have the curiosity to explore versus just trying to get it right"

New text saved:[6687.20s - 6690.64s] 'yeah that's and that's probably a big invitation also for everyone who's listening which has been helpful for me is asking myself that question like at any point throughout my day in conversation with somebody and creating something uh is there subconscious or conscious um cognizance of how something is being perceived externally and how it's point how it's being appeared because in that alteration of behavior lies like where we're we're trapped and we're not free you know'

New text saved:[6727.55s - 6760.50s] 'The difference between being self-conscious and self-expressed is akin to having the governor on like the brake and the accelerator, versus just taking it as it is. This distinction resonates deeply with our personal journey of understanding ourselves beyond the illusion of a self.'

New text saved:[6884.80s - 6890.88s] 'we're here to transcend the constraints we which we arrived and this brilliant paradigm has got exactly the circumstances you need for that to eventually happen.'

New text saved:[6929.68s - 6948.40s] "life will present you with people and circumstances to reveal where you're not free it really is a probably my favorite quote of yours and really does encapsulate like what this human experience is and how it happens in the reflections and mirrors in our life and when we've kind of dissolved a certain aspect you know or overcome one one aspect of life there is usually another mirror down the road that's coming right something more subtle something more refined"

New text saved:[6986.69s - 7059.60s] right like and there's no one in the world at the best of the best they don't get it perfect

[6990.77s - 7001.57s] that you know Ben Hogan one of the greatest he said you know and his best round of golf he hit

[6994.45s - 7007.25s] four perfect shots you know it's like it's the consistent exploration of what it is to be us

[7007.25s - 7020.77s] and there's a joy to that like you know it's at times it can be a pain in the ass because it's

[7020.77s - 7048.38s] never ending but that's also part of the the the gift that it is to be alive to taste it or to

[7048.38s - 7053.42s] feel it all and to explore it all yeah it's it's again the paradox of being a limitless being within

[7053.42s - 7066.96s] this finite human experience I remember listening to a tape where Ram Dass was talking about how

[7066.96s - 7080.19s] he's tried every plant medicine and every every mantra he's done and every teacher you know as

[7080.19s - 7094.58s] if there is a place other than the human experience we're supposed to get to yeah and you know the

[7094.58s - 7111.13s] deeper realization was like what if I actually came here to have a human experience yeah how funny

[7111.13s - 7128.53s] you know me us being humans and and it just invites again accepting more of our own humanity

[7128.53s - 7159.60s] in the process of what it means to to be here in this realm I watched a clip recently on on the on

[7159.60s - 7166.08s] the gram and this guy I don't know who it was just came up in my feed and he was talking about how

[7166.08s - 7176.16s] he because of a really bad accident he couldn't feel anything right like sort of a form of paralysis

[7176.16s - 7184.32s] and it was so beautiful because he said when I got back you know and I started to heal it took

[7184.32s - 7192.19s] months he said I really enjoyed pain not because pain is good but because I got to feel and I really

New text saved:[7080.19s - 7177.50s] think you know that's one of if we were to look at this through some bigger lens of the universe

[7084.03s - 7177.50s] that we talked about right at the beginning that gods have sent us to this particular dimension

[7087.87s - 7177.50s] of planet earth I really feel that the ultimate intention of what it is to be human is just to

[7093.23s - 7177.50s] feel fill in the blank it doesn't matter it doesn't have to be joy and like you know euphoria and

[7099.06s - 7177.50s] orgasm it could be like fucking heartache I mean I love the fact that I love my dad so much it

[7111.38s - 7177.50s] hurt that he died you know it's all it's all an expression of love right in different different

[7117.06s - 7177.50s] ways like and that to me is the gift that it is to be human and so whenever we deny ourselves

[7123.38s - 7177.50s] feeling something you're cutting off what it is to be alive and vital and we're so programmed to

[7127.62s - 7177.50s] like well we only want the good shit right like don't want the bad stuff and it's like no there's

[7133.70s - 7177.50s] there's joy in all of it underneath it's just the capacity to feel itself is the opportunity that

[7139.17s - 7177.50s] is to be human that's saying I don't know what the truth is but I know what love feels like

[7146.83s - 7177.50s] and we are here to have that feeling experience and thank you for the continual reminder that

[7156.46s - 7177.50s] your presence is to to to remember that power you know and your gift as I've shared many times in

[7162.22s - 7177.50s] the articulation of the inner dimension is second to none and you know I'm just grateful

[7167.26s - 7177.50s] for the mirror that we get to be for each other and it's been a pleasure to spend more time with

[7172.54s - 7177.50s] you you know even going to Mexico for a week and getting I mean we're just constantly joking

[7177.50s - 7177.50s] anytime we're with each other it's just one big shit show of just laughter and playfulness

New text saved:[7256.74s - 7265.18s] "a life that's more fulfilling than one that makes a difference"
