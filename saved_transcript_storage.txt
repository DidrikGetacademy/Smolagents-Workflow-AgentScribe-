New text saved:[227.08s - 238.08s] So clearly if you're going to get good at jujitsu you got to be the you got to be disciplined enough to train all the time same thing with being in the military if you're going to be a good operator you have to have the discipline to push yourself in training.

New text saved:[251.08s - 259.08s] You definitely want to have be creative and figure out creative solutions and things that people haven't thought of and things that the enemy is not going to think of or that your opponents not going to think of.

New text saved:[260.08s - 268.08s] So you got to find that person who has a good balance between discipline and kind of a wild freedom creativity that they can make adjustments.

New text saved:[269.08s - 277.14s] It's interesting to think that more focus or more efficiency isn't always the solution to everything.

New text saved:[296.17s - 305.17s] What does that engender what's that environment creating for them but then when they need to go and file their taxes trying to file their taxes in that same room is probably not a good idea.

New text saved:[411.37s - 417.37s] So you ended up with a bunch of guys in the SEAL teams that were pretty open minded and they could kind of look at problems and figure out how to solve them.

New text saved:[601.42s - 619.71s] One of the things that I've been thinking about a lot recently is whether it's possible to take too much responsibility or too much ownership where you start to believe that you're at fault or you're accountable for things and blame yourself too frequently blame yourself too much.

New text saved:[689.15s - 703.15s] And oftentimes it's pretty easy just to say oh that's not me that's not on me and I think that's that's the whole genesis of the idea of extreme ownership is most of the time or much of the time people say that's not my fault.

New text saved:[833.92s - 849.92s] You cannot act this way this reflects bad on all of us and maybe you and I might even say listen if you keep this up you're not even working here anymore I'm gonna have to get rid of you say I know I do I love working with you it's gonna be great I won't do it again and maybe that solves your problem

New text saved:[858.98s - 866.98s] And I have to take ownership of the fact that you are actually not capable of doing this job that I've asked you so that's fine

New text saved:[898.98s - 911.98s] And at some point you say you know what I've made these adjustments I've come home you know on time I've texted you when I was going to be late.
[911.98s - 925.98s] So yeah there's there's plenty of times where taking ownership means actually solving the problem not continuing to to pour the problem down your neck every night because that's not very helpful to anybody.

New text saved:[986.72s - 991.72s] 'Discipline equals freedom'

New text saved:[1135.52s - 1141.52s] And if you don't work hard for something you're not going to get an outcome that's really worth much.

New text saved:[1197.40s - 1201.94s] The discomfort that I was feeling, the effort, the pain, the sweat.

New text saved:[1213.97s - 1219.97s] It's like, look, this is the reason why the re-rupture rate is five to 10% because people don't want to do this thing.

New text saved:[1244.45s - 1245.45s] And I think that that's why it's attractive. [1268.08s - 1269.08s] Is this a dynamic that you've seen? [1279.08s - 1285.08s] And they know that they're not maybe working as hard as they could be and they're not really achieving what they want to achieve.

New text saved:[1597.34s - 1605.34s] Was there anything you think that people misinterpreted about that video or about good generally as a concept?
[1606.34s - 1612.34s] Look, look, if you take any idea and you take it to an extreme, then that idea is going to become bad.
[1613.34s - 1614.34s] That's the idea of extreme ownership.

New text saved:[1660.63s - 1667.63s] And if you curl up into a ball and complain about it, that's not going to help you.
[1664.63s - 1667.63s] Here's some adjustments I can make to move forward.
[1667.63s - 1670.43s] That's going to be a better move than, than cowering.

New text saved:[1769.00s - 1771.00s] If I could, I would even shorten the syllables as well.

New text saved:[1805.50s - 1815.76s] It's my belief that most of the qualities that you have, your integrity, your virtue, your discipline, your hard work, your growth-mindedness, your humor, your resilience, all of that are forces that are very, very difficult for you.
[1816.76s - 1820.76s] To slow down and that once they've got started, it's incredibly hard for you to stop them.
[1821.76s - 1828.82s] And what you're doing with all of the extra concern that comes over the top of that is just making your day-to-day experience of it a lot more miserable.

New text saved:[1887.37s - 1915.91s] And there's a part of that that makes me think about good is an active philosophy, right? It's actively saying something happens. I'm going to lean into it. I'm going to be forward motion, right? And then the backup that you seem to have behind that as well is look at all of the things that I've dealt with before. Look at all of the effectiveness that I've come through with previously.

New text saved:[1996.57s - 1999.67s] 'Discipline is infinitely more important.'

New text saved:[1999.67s - 2002.67s] 'So no matter how you feel, get up and do what you're supposed to do.'

New text saved:[2028.71s - 2035.93s] He said that courage or bravery, I think is actually what he was talking about. It's an emotion that you can't fake. If you fake bravery when you're terrified, that is bravery.

New text saved:[2065.09s - 2067.09s] Just shut up and go do what you're supposed to do.

New text saved:[2104.09s - 2109.09s] It's one of the most compelling reasons for doing a morning training workout for me.

New text saved:[2127.21s - 2129.34s] Discipline equals freedom.

New text saved:[2161.53s - 2166.53s] Just do the thing, man.

New text saved:[2201.79s - 2214.92s] I think courage has to have some kind of risk involved. And then, yes, I agree with Sam Harris when he pointed out that if you're acting, if you're doing the thing, then that's courage. No matter how you feel inside your little brain.

New text saved:[2295.13s - 2310.77s] Courage is very hard to find when life gets comfortable for people. How can they stop their bravery from eroding when times are easy? Do something that's hard and do it every day.

New text saved:[2359.63s - 2360.63s] And there's people that have come from every walk of life that have stepped up in that situation.

New text saved:[2445.86s - 2448.86s] So if you think that you're going to be able to drop someone with one punch or you think

New text saved:[3521.84s - 3530.80s] she was strong to be able to handle just just mayhem mayhem on a pretty regular basis you know

New text saved:[4089.72s - 4098.33s] wish them luck walk away and don't look back and you're still going to get those emotions those things are still going to hit you but walk away and don't look back

New text saved:[4200.60s - 4215.12s] 'care or something like that yeah it helps to you know it helps to write about what i've told people to do is write that person a letter and tell them what you loved about them what you're going to miss about them how you felt about them what you regret you write all that stuff in a letter put an envelope bring it to their grave and put it there and and that will help you process as well'

New text saved:[4482.01s - 4558.28s] you know as you mentioned earlier if there's a bigger a much bigger person than you they can still beat you up you know and that's the thing with kids you know if you're 10 years old you can be a really well-trained 10 year old but a 14 year old is probably going to get the better of you and maybe 15 year old but there's still going to be situations that it's going to be you you're going to lose a fight that being said the risk for the bully goes exponentially higher when he knows that he's got someone on his hands that can actually knows how to fight and so the probability of bullying taking place goes way down way down and even if that bully wins the fight he's not going to look good it's going to be a problem he he's going to he's going to get a uh a victory a worthless victory because he's going to beat up so he's going to barely get the better of someone that's a lot smaller than than the bully himself so and all this stuff all this stuff i guess we're going to talk to andrew huberman but this is stuff you recognize there's a there's a primal recognition of someone that knows how to fight and someone that doesn't

New text saved:[4674.33s - 4678.57s] 'in training and in becoming stronger in being able to do pull-ups in being able to run you know for the young kid that's running that kid's got some good cardio if he's timing his mile runs right all those things are gonna help make a more capable human who is a lot less likely by the way he's more confident'

New text saved:[4833.26s - 4839.82s] that's again a great reason to get out there and train it's kind of like a superpower

New text saved:[5279.53s - 5286.44s] the worst days of my life were in war losing my friends and war is horrible and the way i responded to it and i asked him if he had anyone had ever known anyone that had cancer and

New text saved:[5387.88s - 5441.10s] 'so i think there's some inherent characteristic of a person that your environment plays a role 
but it can be overcome by determination and i think you probably have a lot more control over 
what you do in your life than your background does that is the i think the genesis of why i love 
the ability to live your life by design not by default'

New text saved:[5451.10s - 5469.69s] the fact that you can come out the other side of that and 
[5460.54s - 5469.69s] realize that it has real world returns to you is it's phenomenal it's it's one of the most 
[5470.41s - 5476.01s] empowering i hate that word but you know what i mean it's just been ruined 
[5479.45s - 5489.05s] is what allows people to move on in life and take control of their life and make things happen and

New text saved:[5734.27s - 5745.15s] 'leadership is a skill just like guitar is a skill. there's moves that are just like playing chords and people don't understand that.'

New text saved:[5890.01s - 5897.13s] 'days go by pretty quickly and we seem to get old a lot sooner perhaps than we expect'

New text saved:[5897.13s - 5903.56s] 'tomorrow is not necessarily promised to us and that things can end pretty quickly'

New text saved:[5951.61s - 5964.24s] to think oh don't worry i got all the time in the world because i know i don't and i'm lucky to be here and i'm gonna try and live in a way that will at least do justice for my friends that aren't here

New text saved:[6023.61s - 6030.40s] 'because of what this person did for me while they were alive now that they've passed look at how much more i'm living look at i mean is there any better tribute to somebody definitely makes you appreciate the sunsets more'

New text saved:[6096.24s - 6101.34s] but there is a point at which you become kind of aware of your own mortality

New text saved:[6134.33s - 6140.17s] it definitely will hurt you and it'll show up you can't get away with what you got away with when you were 23 it doesn't work you you have to you have to stay ahead of it

New text saved:[7167.29s - 7175.07s] and now is one of the things that's at the front of my mind that when you have somebody that goes on operation and serves it's not just them that pay the price and it's not just them and the support units that are out there and the drivers and the people on the ground and the fixes and the translators and stuff there's a literal army of people back home as well

New text saved:[7597.05s - 7601.13s] i think is a byproduct of someone that has a lot of forward momentum i think that when you've just

New text saved:[7743.07s - 7761.39s] 'you have to look for what what's the trade-off going to be i'm going to win a little bit here i'm going to lose a little bit there but overall it's going to move me in the right direction i think it's a good thing to understand as opposed to going through life thinking that you're going to find a 100 percent solution because it's not going to exist so you're going to have to make trade-offs in life'

New text saved:[7781.40s - 7792.52s] 'regrets were a bug not a feature of life i didn't realize that they were baked into the literal fabric of how we exist'

New text saved:[7818.46s - 7826.16s] one of the things that you need to consider is which of these regrets can i live with and which of these regrets can i not live with and that there's no solutions only trade-offs

New text saved:[8017.05s - 8028.09s] 'you should break down the 25 year plan into five year blocks into one-year sprints into quarterly goals or whatever and it's just never resonated with me it's never resonate it doesn't appeal to my nature it doesn't appeal to the way that life is by design unpredictable and you don't know what skills you're going to acquire what setbacks or advantages are going to come your way'

New text saved:[8052.33s - 8059.61s] yeah look at the mistakes we've made well america is made as a country in war why because we had a long-term strategy that didn't make sense and guess what no one was willing to say hey this long-term strategy we've got is not working we need to make some adjustments and we need to do it now instead nope ignore those numbers ignore the the feedback loop that we're getting just press forward with this strategy that we're on doesn't doesn't work

New text saved:[8279.82s - 8286.22s] "my partner at echelon front leif babin pointed this out to me like a year ago he just said he said you know you're really good he was doing some stuff that he didn't want to be doing"

New text saved:[8461.40s - 8467.96s] and grow as the demand signal is there grow and you know i've done things that were didn't work

New text saved:[8474.36s - 8478.52s] a lot and so just because i think something is cool doesn't mean other people are gonna think

New text saved:[8484.92s - 8490.89s] i'm not going to overly invest in something that that people might not want at all

New text saved:[8500.09s - 8504.97s] only you can do your podcast only i can do my podcast precisely only you can write your books

New text saved:[8539.42s - 8544.78s] do not outsource the thing that drives the revenue the thing that drives the revenue must be protected at all costs

New text saved:[8549.45s - 8555.71s] my motivation is waning to do the thing to write the book to do the podcast to give the speeches whatever because of the amount of administration

New text saved:[8560.83s - 8567.39s] there's that's the point of highest leverage for us yeah get that blockage out of the way

New text saved:[8674.49s - 8684.17s] we just changed every single flavor starting now but that took that took trial and error of me saying wait a second i love the way this tastes but seven out of ten people that yeah it's okay three out of ten people say this doesn't taste good at all that's that's not a success you gotta have ten out of ten people say this freaking tastes delicious

New text saved:[8858.17s - 8895.02s] you can't change it to one time and now you can defend yourself or you can't pick up a guitar
[8895.02s - 8898.30s] one time it's the same thing with leadership you can't just sit through one seminar or read one
[8898.30s - 8902.30s] book and go okay cool I've got I mean imagine if you picked up a book on guitar and you read it
[8902.30s - 8908.30s] and now you thought you were going to be able to play a guitar or you read a book about basketball
[8908.30s - 8912.30s] and now look you would get the concepts down you would understand what you're going to be working
[8912.30s - 8918.30s] toward but it's a legitimate skill that you have to employ in scenarios to get better at

New text saved:[9048.12s - 9052.76s] you have to lead your boss your boss doesn't know what's happening in the field your boss doesn't know what time that concrete should be poured your boss doesn't know what what time uh those those those forms need to be set up by it doesn't know that

New text saved:[9048.12s - 9052.76s] you have to lead your boss your boss doesn't know what's happening in the field your boss doesn't know what time that concrete should be poured your boss doesn't know what what time uh those those those forms need to be set up by it doesn't know that

New text saved:[9063.52s - 9076.72s] you have to lead your boss in that right direction you have to lead your peers in the right direction you have to lead your family in the right direction you have to even if you're you by leading your family that means putting your ego in check and listening to what your kids have to say
