[911.98s - 925.98s] So yeah there's there's plenty of times where taking ownership means actually solving the problem not continuing to to pour the problem down your neck every night because that's not very helpful to anybody.






[1606.34s - 1612.34s] Look, look, if you take any idea and you take it to an extreme, then that idea is going to become bad.
[1613.34s - 1614.34s] That's the idea of extreme ownership.

[1664.63s - 1667.63s] Here's some adjustments I can make to move forward.
[1667.63s - 1670.43s] That's going to be a better move than, than cowering.


[1816.76s - 1820.76s] To slow down and that once they've got started, it's incredibly hard for you to stop them.
[1821.76s - 1828.82s] And what you're doing with all of the extra concern that comes over the top of that is just making your day-to-day experience of it a lot more miserable.

what you do in your life than your background does that is the i think the genesis of why i love

[8902.30s - 8908.30s] and now you thought you were going to be able to play a guitar or you read a book about basketball
[8908.30s - 8912.30s] and now look you would get the concepts down you would understand what you're going to be working

[738.11s - 739.63s] I taught English in Spain.
[739.63s - 740.63s] Trying to write a novel.
[740.63s - 741.63s] I had no discipline.
[741.63s - 742.63s] I couldn't do it.
[742.63s - 743.63s] It didn't work.



[1228.69s - 1234.45s] amazement and seem like you mean it is a rare and dying talent, but one still greatly valued.









[2121.89s - 2125.97s] is known for always putting on good parties, then you get to benefit from that.









New text saved:[2478.13s - 2483.73s] And in another way, it's very, never let anybody else define it for you.
[2484.45s - 2489.81s] You know, allowing that sort of vacuum to seep in loses you your power over your reputation
[2489.81s - 2492.13s] and allows other people to derogate it.

New text saved:[2679.70s - 2684.02s] Always stick to what makes you weird, odd, strange, different.

New text saved:[2738.72s - 2741.12s] There is something strange and weird about you.
[2741.84s - 2746.16s] Once again, I hate to say it, but it's a chapter that I'm writing right now for my sublime book.

New text saved:[2896.10s - 2900.10s] Even Albert Einstein, there's nobody else like Einstein. There's nobody like Da Vinci.

New text saved:[2945.71s - 2956.83s] You have that potential. It's just you're not putting the effort into, you're lazy. You want to fit into the group because it's easy. But your oddness, what makes you weird, what makes you different, that little strange quirk in how you want to dress yourself, that little strange quirk in your musical tastes, that little quirk in the food that you like to eat, that is who you are. Those are signs from deep within, from your core, from your soul.

New text saved:[3017.01s - 3027.22s] So when I had the 48 laws of power,
[3028.22s - 3036.19s] when I first wrote the book without it being published yet, it was a very strange looking
[3036.19s - 3043.31s] book and it reflects my own strangeness, things on the margins, stories, everything broken up,
[3043.31s - 3049.81s] images, quotes here and there. It's kind of how my brain is, a hodgepodge, kind of a mess really.
[3050.72s - 3055.10s] And the publishers, they bought the book, but then they came back to us and they said,
[3055.74s - 3061.50s] Robert, can you kind of maybe make this more like other books? Can you get rid of all those sections
[3061.50s - 3068.02s] and everything? And I said, no, take it or leave it. This is the book as it is. It's odd, it's strange.

New text saved:[3095.30s - 3099.22s] bit of courage, you need to stand up and say, I'm okay being different.

New text saved:[3100.03s - 3106.61s] It's fascinating that lots of people, maybe most people want to be extraordinary in some way, but also don't want to stand out in a way that allows them to be mocked. But the latter is the price of the former.

New text saved:[3111.65s - 3117.81s] You can't behave the way that everybody else does and expect to not get the results that everybody else gets.

New text saved:[3194.34s - 3207.54s] I actually think in some ways, maybe I would go as far as to say that it is our duty to humanity. I think it's our duty to embrace the things that only you can do.

New text saved:[3252.58s - 3266.10s] Chris is for a purpose. You are marked that way because by mining your uniqueness, your weirdness, your oddness, your little quirky tastes, you're going to contribute something new to the culture

New text saved:[3323.44s - 3328.64s] In fact, there's that famous job application that Da Vinci sends, I think, to the king of Italy and Da Vinci is sort of listing all of the different things that he can do. I can make machines for war and a trebuchet and a blah, blah, blah. The final paragraph, he writes the sentence, also I can paint. I always think about also I can paint. What is the also I can paint that I don't see in myself? What are the things that my friends really value?

New text saved:[3403.68s - 3408.24s] And I think getting in getting another perspective and that really gave me pause.

New text saved:[3478.16s - 3491.04s] 'Find the way that it's a strength and see it as a strength and use it and don't have second thoughts about it. Use it for power. And don't be so conflicted about it. It's all how you look at it.'

New text saved:[3569.66s - 3578.96s] 'You can't control it. It's who you are. And maybe that you can't control it is a good thing. And maybe it's there for a reason.'

New text saved:[3683.98s - 3698.46s] And you think, well, God, you know, the things that you're punished for when you're a child are the things that you think are malignant when you're a child you're often rewarded for if you can just find a way to alchemise them as an adult.

New text saved:[3820.02s - 3825.06s] I think it's swimming upstream or swimming downstream is working against or working with your nature and trying to find a way to make it work for you as opposed to trying to change it so that you can find a way to make it work.

New text saved:[3820.02s - 3825.06s] I think it's swimming upstream or swimming downstream is working against or working with your nature and trying to find a way to make it work for you as opposed to trying to change it so that you can find a way to make it work.

New text saved:[3897.62s - 3903.30s] And that means that I can, because I've seen this guy do it and it's a weirdo role model or a weirdness role model. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think we all need that in our life. People who are different, I remember in high school, I had an English teacher who kind of changed the course of my life. And he was very weird. He was very different. His way of thinking was different and how he talked about writing and literature was very odd. And I, other students hated him. And I thought he was just fantastic.

New text saved:[4008.69s - 4013.97s] You are your own worst enemy. You waste precious time dreaming of the future instead of engaging in the present.

New text saved:[4142.46s - 4148.46s] So your brain needs pressure. It needs constant pressure and stress and pressure is not a bad thing. We have this thing where we feel like stress is bad. It's bad for you. Bad. You know, you need to relax, man. You need to chill. Stress will kill you. No, being bored will kill you. Not having anything to do will kill you is much more dangerous than stress.

New text saved:[4220.35s - 4226.11s] if I didn't have a deadline, I would take forever. Money on it. Money on it. Money on it. Yeah. So create pressure for yourself is a good thing.

New text saved:[4377.57s - 4381.57s] It was a monumental work of persistence and discipline and detail, but he had a deadline.

New text saved:[4381.57s - 4386.93s] He didn't want to disappoint the public. He had to get it done in five years and he did get it done in five years.

New text saved:[4433.47s - 4439.31s] your idiosyncrasies and your weirdness. But if you can funnel it to motivate you to go forward.

New text saved:[4511.47s - 4516.99s] So yeah, being able to use the social mores to kind of pull you to where you want to be to understand again your own fallibility and insecurities and attach those like a south and a north magnet and sort of use that to pull you along.

New text saved:[4516.99s - 4525.12s] I always like to riff on what you're saying. I always like to challenge myself.

New text saved:[4604.78s - 4610.78s] And that's the game of life. So if Edison had said, I'm going to light the entire world in five years away. New York was a pretty hefty lift. I'm going to light New York in 50 years also. Yeah, exactly, which is probably more realistic. It was a challenge. It was a pretty big challenge.

New text saved:[4777.57s - 4784.61s] 'So 50, he did his first album called Power of the Dollar. And I have a kind of a bootleg copy of it he gave me. It's absolutely fun. It's available now pretty much on the internet. It's absolutely fantastic.'

New text saved:[4855.02s - 4866.37s] 'he goes, well, the lesson is, I can't be dependent on a record label. They're too conservative. I'm somebody who lives on the edge. My music plays on the fact that I was a crack dealer, that I live dangerously, that I'm the real thing.'

New text saved:[4905.65s - 4914.26s] He learned not to take success for granted and he built on that. And so he's not a one hit wonder.

New text saved:[4972.70s - 4977.50s] you failed so many times, you're probably going to fail again. Right? You've seen so many people in Hollywood who started off hot and bombed. I had experience to know that I can't take this for granted. I have to be careful. I have to be strategic. I have to build on it and not let the success go to my head.

New text saved:[5208.32s - 5212.72s] Because he is someone that I think did learn the right lessons from it going right on his first attempt that he shouldn't take things for granted, that maybe that was a fluke, that he does still need to work hard. Some of the lessons that failure would have taught you.

New text saved:[5385.04s - 5399.20s] But even if the entire room, the whole council thought that it was fantastic, tell me how this is wrong. That's part of my consulting with business people that I've had over the years.

New text saved:[5464.08s - 5474.70s] 'Being attacked is a sign that you were important enough to be a target. You should relish the attention and the chance to prove yourself.'

New text saved:[5481.92s - 5491.74s] 'If everything is easy in life, if everyone loves what you're going to do, and you have no enemies, you have no opposition, nothing to resist, you're just going to be mush. You're not going to amount to anything. You're not going to be able to push yourself. You're not going to be able to change, evolve.'

New text saved:[5496.14s - 5503.10s] - A nemesis like Joe Frazier put me on a much higher level. Without the Joker, what's the Batman?

New text saved:[5525.92s - 5537.62s] - Pressure is a privilege in that way.

New text saved:[5586.10s - 5587.06s] - The intersection.

New text saved:[5617.76s - 5625.84s] I had to raise my game. It was the first time in my writing career, writing books that I was facing, failure, real failure. If I didn't succeed in that book, 50 would have thought something was wrong. And we'd announced the publication, people, I would have maybe recovered, but it would have been a major blow.

New text saved:[5699.76s - 5704.16s] The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear. If you're already established 
[5704.16s - 5708.88s] in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked about, even more admired.

New text saved:[5708.88s - 5712.40s] You must learn when to leave, cultivate value through scarcity.

New text saved:[5752.66s - 5766.16s] Napoleon said, 'if I show up at the theater every night in Paris, in my little emperor's box, people start taking me for granted. If I show up every week, they'll be going, and that's interesting, but he's coming every week. If I show up once a month, it's like an event. Oh my God, he came here. When is he coming next? Whoa, it's all this attention.'

New text saved:[5858.56s - 5862.16s] aloofness is alluring.

New text saved:[5988.34s - 5994.58s] You have to know that maybe in social media, it's, you can't disappear for a year or even a month,
[5994.58s - 5999.86s] but if you do it for a week, people will notice it and they start thinking about you.
[6002.26s - 6009.46s] I think there's a momentum build as well that perhaps is everybody, a price that you need to pay in the beginning.

New text saved:[6132.42s - 6139.38s] So you have to master these very subtle and invisible rules of psychology. And so knowing,
[6139.38s - 6145.22s] some people know it by instinct. They have a marketing sense that I need to break up
[6145.22s - 6151.54s] expectations if everything is always the same. There's no surprise. Okay. But you have to understand,
[6151.54s - 6155.46s] you have to think about the, how people are going to respond. You have to understand the
[6155.46s - 6162.26s] psychology involved. That surprise gets attention. That's what's not as expected stands out and
[6162.26s - 6169.52s] people are excited. They're interested in it. Okay.

New text saved:[6232.37s - 6237.17s] you just knew out instinctively. I don't know how some people maybe don't get that kind of thing,

New text saved:[6331.04s - 6341.74s] 'The most powerful idea that he has, and he has a lot of powerful ideas, is that people rise to an elevated position based on a certain quality that they have that makes them stand out.'

New text saved:[6385.36s - 6393.31s] would be a man or a woman, but his time would be a man who could continually adapt to circumstances, who just didn't have one form of power.

New text saved:[6399.23s - 6410.19s] You have to be able to shift with fortune and ride it and keep riding it upward and upward.

New text saved:[6414.51s - 6427.46s] to use your confidence in a different manner when the time asks for something different.

New text saved:[6478.42s - 6483.70s] They weren't so rigid in how they read the 48 laws of power. They weren't so rigid in their politics. They
[6483.70s - 6490.10s] weren't so rigid in their creative life. So it's finding play again in some way, I suppose.

New text saved:[6868.35s - 6880.91s] who is decent, who treated women well. So treating women well is a masculine virtue, [6880.91s - 6885.47s] is a good thing. It comes from a position of strength. You're not insecure about your masculinity, [6885.47s - 6896.43s] You don't have to prove that you're a man by demeaning women, by pushing them around, [6896.43s - 6901.07s] by calling them whores and bitches, etc. You don't have to take the Andrew Tate path in life, [6901.07s - 6907.15s] You can respect women and respecting them is a sign of your strength, is a sign of being secure [6907.15s - 6912.99s] in your masculinity. You don't need to put other people down to make yourself feel better.

New text saved:[6949.10s - 6955.02s] And it's a cultural problem because men are very confused. I didn't have that confusion when I was growing up, you know. So now it's very difficult because you're being told that all these things that you feel naturally are negative. They're only negative if you can control them.

New text saved:[7047.47s - 7054.83s] I channel it into something as opposed to hurting other people kind of thing. So finding ways to 
[7054.83s - 7061.07s] channel your aggressive tendencies is a positive way of being a man. You have to find whatever 
[7061.07s - 7067.20s] that is. Sports is a great example, but there are other things as well.

New text saved:[7113.94s - 7126.29s] Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you have to be smart and you have to be in control of yourself and you have to 
[7126.93s - 7132.61s] be disciplined. But let's just add discipline to one of those other masculine virtues.
[7133.25s - 7148.61s] We need people out there, men and even women who feel comfortable 
[7148.61s - 7157.73s] with this, saying these are the virtues. These are the good sides of being a man and being 
[7157.73s - 7164.05s] masculine.

New text saved:[7195.41s - 7203.09s] 'Some, so many powerful qualities actually come from a position of great weakness and insecurity.'

New text saved:[7342.83s - 7351.95s] So it's going to alter how you look at nature, how you look at animals, how you look at yourself.

New text saved:[7335.95s - 7342.03s] It's going to alter a little bit how you look at things as if you microdosed on something. It's books kind of like microdosing.

New text saved:[7315.55s - 7322.75s] And so every chapter, I'm trying to challenge you and say that the world is different and actually much more exciting and interesting than you think it is.

New text saved:[227.08s - 238.08s] So clearly if you're going to get good at jujitsu you got to be the you got to be disciplined enough to train all the time same thing with being in the military if you're going to be a good operator you have to have the discipline to push yourself in training.
