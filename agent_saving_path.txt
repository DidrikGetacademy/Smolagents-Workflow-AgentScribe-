[546.22s - 553.04s] side of the room. All they notice is the one thing that's wrong or irritating them. They don't even notice all of the amazing things that are going on around them. Isn't it interesting when I describe this negative, pessimistic person? You know exactly who I'm talking about. And you're probably thinking, dear God, do not sit them next to me at the next family wedding. I do not want to hear this, okay? I do not like that kind of mindset or that mood. I do not want dark colored glasses skewing the way that I enjoy this situation right now. And here's the craziest thing about mindset. You know that pessimistic person you and I were just thinking about? They have no idea that they have dark glasses on. This is just the way they see the world. I'm going to give you another example of mindset and how important this is. I want you to think about someone you work with, or maybe you go to school person who has a can-do attitude. No matter how tight the deadline or how rude the customer is that you guys are waiting on, or how much other team members are slacking off, this one person with a can-do attitude, they always see the bright side. Or they have this unbelievable ability to just shrug off the rudeness of other people or the laziness of the students that are on your group project. And they literally can just flip it and turn to you and go, well, you know, they probably have something going on in their personal life. It's as if they always see any situation or any relationship from the positive. They see possibility. They give people the benefit of the doubt. They assume good intent. This too is a mindset. It's just like putting on a rosy pair of sunglasses. Everything is sharper, clearer, brighter when you have this kind of mindset. Even a cloudy, crappy day looks like a beautiful sunrise. In fact, there's a really cool study from the University of Toronto about rose-colored glasses. This isn't just a saying. When you wear rose-colored glasses, your attitude is better. And there's even more based on this research. When you wear rose-colored glasses, you even see more. Your visual horizon is expanded because these rose-colored glasses put you in a good mood. Your mindset determines the way you view the world. And that determines how you think. So I want to do a gut check right now with you. If you had to tell the truth, or actually, let's make this really accurate. If your best friend had to describe the color of the sunglasses that you wear, would they say that you're more on the lane of the dark, bug-eyed, plastic glasses that just skewed everything like it was midnight? Or are you more on the range of everything's rosy? You're always positive. You are always upbeat. You see beauty where most people see nothing. Do a quick gut check with yourself because your mindset is critical. It shapes the way you view the world. And that determines how and what you think about. It also determines how you feel about the present moment, about your past, and about the future. And most importantly, this is where it gets really important. Your mindset determines what actions you take and what actions you don't take. And it also impacts how you see other people. So for example, if I asked you, so what's your mom like? Before you even answer the question, you subconsciously drop on sunglasses, and it filters your opinion about her. And by having a filter about another person, it also limits what's possible for her. You think she just is that way, which means there's no room for her to change. So why is mindset and getting intentional about changing your mindset? Why is this so important? Why do you need to know what color the lens is that you view the world through? And more importantly, why it's time to pop those lenses out if they don't serve you and put in different lenses so that you can see things differently. I'll tell you why your mindset is so important. Because so much of your potential is either limited or expanded by your mindset. I proved to you almost every single episode on the Mel Robbins podcast, that with the right attitude and consistent action, you can absolutely change.

[830.04s - 836.04s] anything about your life or your health or your relationships for the better. And if you're walking around right now with a really negative mindset, you've got those dark bug-eyed glasses on, and you're sitting there every single day telling yourself day in and day out that there is nothing that you can do about this situation, this job, this relationship, this health condition that you've tried, that you failed, that you don't deserve it, that you don't know how, I want you to consider that your own mindset is keeping you stuck in that broken situation. Because your mindset is not inspiring you to do anything about it. Being able to spot those dark lenses, pop them out, put in something brighter, rosier, more luminous, it's going to change everything. And here's why. When you feel more hopeful, or when you see options, and you start to tell yourself, well, why not? Why don't I just try it? What if it works out? Why don't I just see what happens? I do deserve to be happier. I don't deserve to be treated like this. I should start speaking up. That rosier mindset, it inspires you to take the actions that change your life. And it's the actions that matter. This is why I love this topic about mindset and what you're about to learn about the filter in your brain so much. Because right now, there are areas in your life where your own mindset is blocking you from taking action. And before we jump into the filter in your brain and changing your mindset, I want to be very clear about something. This conversation today, it's not about positive thinking. You and I are talking about training your mind to work for you. That's very different. This is not toxic positivity. I'm not asking you to put a positive spin on a shitty situation. I'm also very clear that thinking nice thoughts, it's not going to get your bills paid. However, if you can get serious and intentional and strategic about training your mind to have a rosier and more optimistic and empowered attitude, you, my friend, will be able to say to yourself, I can do this. You will be able to say, you know what? I know my student debt is piled from the floor to the ceiling and I have not opened those bills in approximately 10 months, but I believe in my ability to figure out how to pay this off.

[1766.06s - 1773.14s] So there is a filter in your mind. It is called the reticular activating system. I'm going to call this the RAS, okay? Here's the visual, because you know your friend Mel loves visuals and metaphors to make this stuff easy. I want you to imagine that there is a hairnet over your brain. This hairnet is a live network of neurons and it is constantly changing in real time. And this RAS, this network of neuron hairnet that sits over your brain as a filter, it has one job, a very important job, mind you. The RAS has to determine in real time, I'm talking nanoseconds, what information it should allow into your conscious mind for you to see and register and what information it will block out from your conscious mind. Another way that you can think about the RAS is think about it like a bouncer in your brain. And the reason why you need a bouncer is because life is sort of like a very popular nightclub. Everybody wants to get in. And because there's so much and so many people and so many things showing up at a very popular nightclub trying to jam their way in the door, you need a bouncer who is deciding who gets in and who has to stand in that long line freezing their ass off in an outfit that is not appropriate for winter trying to get in, okay?

[2467.03s - 2472.77s] and you go into work, you know what happens to you at work? You don't see the 15 things that you do [2472.77s - 2480.82s] right. You know what you obsess over? The one thing you've done wrong. That one email that you sent [2480.82s - 2487.24s] that was a screw up, that one customer that you didn't quite do a good job with, the one thing you've [2487.24s - 2494.26s] done wrong is all that you can focus on. Well, when you start to doubt yourself, this is where the [2494.26s - 2501.56s] RAS starts to make it worse. Because your RAS sees you spending so much energy and mental fuel [2501.56s - 2509.04s] in criticizing, doubting, and hesitating. And so your RAS thinks, oh my gosh, ding, ding, ding. Peter [2509.04s - 2515.72s] thinks it's important for him to see what's wrong. And so your RAS blocks the 15 things that you did [2515.72s - 2520.78s] right. You know what you did today, Peter? You sent 32 emails. Great job. You didn't see it though. [2521.26s - 2524.76s] You did a great job with those five customers. You're not giving yourself credit though. [2525.54s - 2530.24s] You were amazing in that meeting earlier. Not getting credit for that either. But the one email, [2530.54s - 2535.36s] the one email, that bouncer's like, come to the front of the line. I'll take the email that is [2535.36s - 2542.50s] negative with the short skirt and that email is getting in. Just like a dark pair of sunglasses, [2542.50s - 2551.24s] shades everything. When you doubt yourself, it shades your mindset toward self-doubt. And then [2551.24s - 2557.38s] your brain gets involved. When the email from your boss comes in, hey, can you stop by my office before [2557.38s - 2563.34s] you leave today? How do you think Peter's RAS interprets that email? If he doubts himself, [2563.92s - 2569.88s] I'll tell you how. When he reads, can you stop by my office before you leave today? His RAS goes, [2569.88s - 2578.67s] oh shit. Because you've trained it to look for things that aren't right. By putting so much time [2578.67s - 2585.79s] and energy into focusing on your self-doubt, you are also training the filter in your brain [2585.79s - 2592.50s] to filter out everything that's going right and to focus only on the one thing that's going wrong, [2593.04s - 2598.76s] thereby magnifying the self-doubt. Let's go back to an earlier example. Remember that pessimistic [2598.76s - 2603.92s] friend sitting on the beach that's bitching that lunch hasn't come or that pessimistic relative [2603.92s - 2612.96s] that is bitching about the family member that's halfway across the tent? It's all they see. They [2612.96s - 2619.38s] can't even see the beautiful water or the happy couple or anything else good. Why? Because their [2619.38s - 2628.10s] pessimism is what has programmed their reticular activating system. This is how mindset and the filter [2628.10s - 2636.15s] in your brain get linked. They become fused together. All you see is the reasons you should doubt [2636.15s - 2642.21s] yourself. It's how you feel. So first it starts with a mindset. You're thinking negative thoughts [2642.21s - 2647.65s] and then your filter gets involved. And next thing you know, you're just seeing more and more and more [2647.65s - 2652.75s] and more reasons to doubt yourself. And here's something that you may be thinking right now. [2652.83s - 2659.34s] Why is my brain doing this to me? Why is my brain against me? Your brain is not working against you. [2660.40s - 2667.32s] It's just responding to where your mindset and all your energy is going. That's it. It follows [2667.32s - 2675.58s] your energy and your focus. And this is the good news, okay? If you get intentional about searching [2675.58s - 2682.10s] for reasons to feel proud or for the small wins, the 15, 32 emails that you sent, the good things that [2682.10s - 2688.50s] you did, the places where you're showing up, your mind will spin like a top. And all of a sudden, [2688.50s - 2692.92s] just like you saw Broncos and babies and Birkenstocks, instead of seeing the one thing [2692.92s - 2698.49s] that you did wrong, you will see the 15 things that you did right. This is not a joke. It's hard [2698.49s - 2705.51s] science. This also, by the way, ties right back into the endless science about the power of a gratitude [2705.51s - 2715.71s] practice. A gratitude practice is a way to train your mind. A gratitude practice is teaching the RAS [2715.71s - 2722.21s] process that being grateful and taking times to savor beautiful moments and focusing on things that [2722.21s - 2727.61s] you're really proud of and you appreciate, that that's important to you so you see more of it. [2728.03s - 2734.79s] That's how this all works hand in hand. And I want to give you one more example, okay? Because I think [2734.79s - 2740.29s] this is challenging at times to see in ourselves because we're so used to seeing the world through
===END_QUOTE===

===START_QUOTE===
[2740.29s - 2746.20s] a certain lens that we don't even realize we're wearing sunglasses. But it is kind of easy to spot in other people. So here's one more example about how your own beliefs and mindset about yourself or a situation that you're in can become paralyzing because the filter in your brain keeps the mindset in place, okay? So think about somebody that you love who's single and they are desperate to meet the right person. And the longer they stay single, the more and more insecure they get by the day. And when you see them, you see a person who is smart, who's awesome, who's hilarious, who's loyal, who's sexy, who's amazing, who would be the most incredible person to be in a relationship with. But I want you to just imagine that the color of the lens on your glasses, when you look through your belief about them, it's completely different than the color of the lens on their glasses. When day in and day out, all this person can think is, why can't I find somebody? I'll never find somebody. Why does everybody else have somebody? I see all my friends getting approached at the bars. I see my friends getting asked out. Why am I not getting asked out? What you've now learned about the mindset and belief about yourself and the way your filter responds in real time is the more energy you put into a negative narrative like this. It's never going to work out for me. Nobody's ever going to love me. I am unlovable. Everybody else has a date. I'm never going to have a date. The more that mindset and that belief becomes a self-fulfilling situation. Why? Because you're putting so much energy into the negative that the filter in your brain is now going to filter the world in a way to reinforce the negative story. When you walk into a bar, all you're going to see are all the couples. You're not even going to focus on all the other people that are single that you should walk up and talk to. That's the bouncer in your brain aligning with where your energy is. This also explains why you as the friend see the opposite. And you can tell the person over and over and over again, you need to calm down. Amazing. You are going to find an amazing person. It's not that you're not going to meet somebody. You just haven't met the right person yet. It's the exact same situation. But because both of you have different mindsets and beliefs about the situation, you see it through a different lens. And you both believe, by the way, that your belief is the truth. And this simple example highlights how your mindset and how you view the world impacts the filter in your brain. Because the more that this carries on for your friend, the less your friend is going to put themselves out there. Because they're slowly convincing themselves that this is never going to happen, so why bother? And the more that you see them pulling back, the more that your belief is going to become, but you need to, but you're the one holding your back. See the filter in your brain, it's either going to make the situation worse or, and this is what I want to teach you, it can make it better. But that depends on your ability to get serious about programming it. Because wouldn't you love it if your friend who wanted to meet somebody would still have a positive mindset or a rosy outlook so that they don't just latch on to some loser? Because you would probably do anything to make sure that this friend of yours, this person that you love, would maintain a positive mindset and a rosy outlook. Why do you want them to maintain that? I'll tell you why. Because your mindset dictates your actions. And if you can stay positive, if you can stay optimistic, if you can keep saying to yourself, there is nothing wrong with me. I just haven't met the right person yet. But one of these days, the right person will walk in, and in the meantime, I'm just going to keep being me. If they can get intentional about creating that mindset, a number of things are going to happen. They're not going to become insecure. They're not going to start acting all weird around people. And they are not going to latch on to some loser just because they are insecure.

And I've spent far too much time beating myself up and looking for what's wrong [4721.49s - 4728.51s] and searching for reasons to feel tortured or lonely and to stop myself. It's just horse shit. I'm so sick of [4728.51s - 4733.83s] it. And I'm sure you're sick of it too. And you know, I'm sharing all this because even though I [4733.83s - 4741.36s] teach this stuff, it's easy stuff to listen to or talk about. You got to put it into practice. And [4741.36s - 4747.97s] so do I. You got to catch yourself when the negativity starts. You got to cut off the voice [4747.97s - 4753.43s] in your head that is not your own. You got to knock this middle school shit off and start claiming your [4753.43s - 4758.69s] adult life. Because you do deserve to be happy. And even if you don't love yourself, I'll tell you [4758.69s - 4764.77s] what, I love you. Even if you don't believe in yourself, that's okay. I believe in you. And I'm [4764.77s - 4770.97s] going to keep on saying it until you catch up with me. Because I do believe that you can take the steps [4770.97s - 4776.79s] to reprogram your mind. You can take the steps to shut up that negativity in your head. You can take the [4776.79s - 4785.23s] steps to filter the world in an entirely new way and see how it's working to help you. And it doesn't [4785.23s - 4794.29s] take a whole lot of time to create a better life. Now go find a heart. I love you. Oh, one more [4794.29s - 4802.41s] thing. It's the legal language.
