Chunk 1 Transcript:
[0.00s - 5.24s] What's happening, people? Welcome back to the show. It is the end of 2025, and to celebrate,
[5.64s - 9.66s] I've put together a collection of my favorite moments from the podcast over the last 12 months.
[9.86s - 14.14s] Some huge episodes that you probably saw, some other episodes that maybe you missed,
[14.60s - 22.40s] and I've put them all together in an interesting flow and pacing, and I really loved all of these.
[22.40s - 28.60s] I love all 1,040 of my podcast children, but these were just some highlights
[28.60s - 34.16s] from 2025. I appreciate you all for being here. I appreciate you all for making Modern Wisdom the
[34.16s - 39.76s] eighth biggest podcast in the world, according to Spotify Wrapped this year, which is insane,
[40.08s - 45.18s] and thank you for all the support and all the shares and all the everything. Thank you for
[45.18s - 52.50s] staying patient with me when I've tried to bring in new ideas and guests that you've never heard of.
[52.50s - 60.78s] I really, really do work hard to try and curate a nice art gallery that even if you don't know who
[60.78s - 66.48s] the artist is, you're probably going to enjoy their work. So thank you for sticking with me as I go
[66.48s - 70.80s] down rabbit holes that you didn't know that you were going to enjoy, and commenting in all of the
[70.80s - 74.82s] support and everything, especially this year more than ever, it's meant an awful lot to me.
[74.82s - 82.02s] So yeah, I appreciate every single one of you. Before we get into it, you need to do an end of
[82.02s - 87.52s] your review, and the review process that I use for myself that I've stolen from all the best
[87.52s - 94.14s] productivity guys on the planet is at chriswillx.com slash review. A hundred thousands, literally hundreds
[94.14s - 98.68s] of thousands of people have recorded it and done their work on it already, and you can get it for
[98.68s - 104.54s] free. Copy it into your notes app and do your end of your review. So chriswillx.com slash review.
[105.42s - 113.84s] Anyway, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year. Let's get into it. The worst outcome in the world is not
[113.84s - 123.60s] having self-esteem. Why? Yeah, it's a tough one. I look at the people, and I don't want to offend
[123.60s - 129.20s] anybody, but I look at the people who don't like themselves, and that's the toughest slot, because
[129.20s - 134.26s] they're always wrestling with themselves, and it's hard enough to face the outside world. And no one's
[134.26s - 138.42s] going to like you more than you like yourself. So if you're struggling with yourself, then the outside
[138.42s - 144.24s] world becomes an insurmountable challenge. And it's hard to say why people have low self-esteem. It
[144.24s - 148.24s] might be genetic. It might just be circumstantial. A lot of times, I think it's because they just
[148.24s - 152.90s] weren't unconditionally loved as a child, and that sort of seeps in at a deep core level.
[154.02s - 160.16s] But self-esteem issues can be the most limiting. One interesting thought is that, you know,
[160.16s - 165.88s] to some extent, self-esteem is a reputation you have with yourself. You're watching yourself at
[165.88s - 169.42s] all times. You know what you're doing, and you have your own moral code. Everyone has a different
[169.42s - 174.30s] moral code. But if you don't live up to your own moral code, the same code that you hold others to,
[174.30s - 180.70s] it will damage your self-esteem. So perhaps one way to build up your self-esteem is to live up to
[180.70s - 186.08s] your own code. Very rigorously have one, and then live up to it. Another way to raise your self-esteem
[186.08s - 192.52s] might be to do things for others. If I look back on my life, and, you know, what are the moments that
[192.52s - 196.62s] I'm actually proud of? There's very far and few between. And it's not that often. It's not the
[196.62s - 200.72s] things you would expect. It's not the material success. It's not having learned this thing or that.
[200.72s - 206.56s] It's when I made a sacrifice for somebody or something that I loved. And that's when I'm
[206.56s - 210.88s] actually ironically most proud. Now that's through an explicit mental exercise, but I'll bet you at
[210.88s - 216.06s] some level I'm recording that implicitly. So that tells me that even if I am not being loved, then the
[216.06s - 221.82s] way to create love is to give love, to express love through sacrifice and through duty. And so I think
[221.82s - 224.68s] doing things like that can build up your self-esteem really fast.
[224.92s - 228.02s] It's interesting when you talk about sacrifice, because a lot of the time people say,
[228.02s - 232.88s] do I sacrifice so much for my job? It's like, yeah, but that was you sacrificing something that
[232.88s - 237.34s] you wanted less for something that you wanted more, as opposed to genuinely taking some sort

thought: 'Intent: This chunk begins with host intro/housekeeping, then shifts into a guest’s motivational reflection on self-esteem,
  its sources, and actionable ways to build it (live up to your moral code; give love through sacrifice and duty). Decision:
  SAVE a single strong, self-contained passage that starts with a clear hook, develops a universal insight, and closes with
  actionable advice. The best segment runs from the assertion “The worst outcome in the world is not having self-esteem.”
  through the conclusive advice “…doing things like that can build up your self-esteem really fast.” Justification: - Standalone:
  It opens with a powerful thesis, explains the concept (self-esteem as reputation with yourself), and provides concrete,
  universally applicable actions (live up to your code; give love via sacrifice/duty) with a clear concluding line. No reliance
  on external context or names. - Impact: Offers deep insight, reframing self-esteem and prescribing disciplined action and
  service; emotionally resonant. - Hook: Strong first sentence is attention-grabbing. - Length: From [105.42s] to [221.82s]
  is ~116.4s if taken entirely; too long. We must trim to stay under 60s while preserving a coherent arc. The strongest concise
  arc begins at [154.02s] “But self-esteem issues…” through [186.08s] “Another way to raise your self-esteem…” then continue
  to [216.06s] and [221.82s] to complete the love/sacrifice advice. Compute total duration: first_start 154.02 to last_end
  221.82 = 67.8s, still too long. A tighter under-60s arc: Start at [160.16s] “to some extent, self-esteem is a reputation
  you have with yourself…” through [186.08s] “…Another way to raise your self-esteem might be to do things for others.” That
  duration: 186.08 − 160.16 = 25.92s, within limit, and it forms a complete mini-arc (diagnosis + one actionable avenue).
  It ends cleanly and doesn’t imply more is needed. This segment is verbatim and context-independent. - Other lines excluded:
  The opener [105.42s - 154.02s] is longer setup and risk of exceeding length; later personal anecdotes [186.08s - 221.82s]
  add richness but push over length if combined; the host’s intro and the sacrifice discussion starting at [224.92s] changes
  speaker and context. Confirmed verbatim copying with exact timestamps in order, no alterations.'

thought: 'Intent: This chunk mixes host intro/promo and a deep reflection on self-esteem, moral code, and sacrifice. Decision:
  REJECT the chunk—no passage satisfies all gates with ≥95% confidence. Justification: • The cleanest motivational arc starts
  at [160.16s] (“to some extent, self-esteem is a reputation…”) and concludes only if extended through [221.82s - 224.68s]
  (“…build up your self-esteem really fast.”). That spans ~64.52s (>60s), failing the length gate. • Trimming earlier creates
  closure issues because line boundaries force mid‑sentence endings: [180.70s - 186.08s] ends with “Another way to raise your
  self-esteem” (incomplete); [206.56s - 210.88s] ends with “but I’ll bet you at” (incomplete); [186.08s - 192.52s] contains

Chunk 2 Transcript:
[237.34s - 246.78s] of cost. And yeah, I wonder whether if self-esteem is you adhering to your internal, your actions
[246.78s - 251.24s] and your values aligning, even when it's difficult, or perhaps even more so when it's difficult,
[251.24s - 258.86s] I wonder whether there is a price that people who are more introspective, high integrity
[258.86s - 266.64s] pay, because you think, well, you've got this heavier set of overheads that you need to pay
[266.64s - 267.10s] in some way.
[267.28s - 273.46s] Well, if being ethical or profitable, everybody would do it, right? So at some level, it does
[273.46s - 278.24s] involve a sacrifice. But that sacrifice can also be thought of as you're thinking for the
[278.24s - 286.04s] long-term rather than the short-term. For example, the virtues are the set of beliefs that if everybody
[286.04s - 291.66s] in society followed them as individuals, it would lead to win-win outcomes for everybody. So if I am
[291.66s - 296.10s] honest and you are honest, then we can do business more easily, we can interact more easily because
[296.10s - 299.94s] we can trust each other. So even though there might be a few liars in the system, as long as
[299.94s - 304.62s] there aren't too many liars and too many cheaters, a high-trust society where everybody's honest is
[304.62s - 309.06s] better off. And I think a lot of the virtues work this way, right? If I don't go around sleeping with
[309.06s - 313.48s] your wife and you don't sleep with mine, and if I don't take all the food that's at the table first
[313.48s - 318.58s] and so on, then we all get along better and we can play win-win games. In game theory, the most
[318.58s - 322.54s] famous game is Prisoner's Dilemma, but that's all about everybody cheating and the Nash equilibrium,
[322.84s - 328.66s] the stable equilibrium there is everybody cheats. And the only way you can play a win-win game is if
[328.66s - 333.46s] you have long-term iterated moves. But that's not actually the most common game played in society.
[333.46s - 338.44s] The most common game played is one called a stag's hunt, where if we cooperate, we can bring down a
[338.44s - 342.86s] big stag and both have big dinners. But if we don't cooperate, then we have to go hunt like rabbits and
[342.86s - 349.84s] we each have small dinners. And that game has two stable equilibriums. And one could be where we're
[349.84s - 353.94s] both hunting the rabbit and one could be where we're hunting the stag. So the high-trust society
[353.94s - 359.04s] is a more virtuous society where I can trust you to come hunt the stag with me and show up on time
[359.04s - 364.72s] and do the work and divide it up properly. So you want to live in a system where everybody has
[364.72s - 370.30s] their own set of virtues and follows them and then we all win. But I would argue you don't need
[370.30s - 374.58s] to do that for sacrifice. You don't need to do that for other people. You can do it just purely for
[374.58s - 379.42s] yourself. You will have higher self-esteem. You will attract other high-virtue people.
[379.66s - 381.32s] Would I go on a stag hunt with me?
[381.44s - 384.42s] Correct. Yeah, that's right. And if you're the kind of person,
[384.42s - 389.92s] if you're the kind of person who long-term signals ethics and virtues, then you'll attract
[389.92s - 395.10s] other people who are ethical and virtuous. Whereas if you are a shark, you will eventually
[395.10s - 399.74s] find yourself swimming entirely amongst sharks. And that's an unpleasant existence. But again,
[399.80s - 403.74s] this goes back to the equivalent of the marshmallow test. And by the way, the marshmallow test does
[403.74s - 405.40s] not replicate fake science.
[405.40s - 407.86s] I saw a complication crisis hard recently.
[408.20s - 414.02s] But it is about trading off the short term for the long term. And so I think for a lot of these
[414.02s - 417.54s] so-called virtues, there are long-term selfish reasons to be virtuous.
[419.32s - 425.90s] Yeah. Did you deal with self-doubt in the past? Is that something that was a hurdle for you to
[425.90s - 426.16s] overcome?
[427.20s - 432.16s] Yes and no. I think I dealt with self-doubt in the sense that, oh, I don't know what I'm doing
[432.16s - 438.96s] and I need to figure it out. But I didn't doubt myself in the way of somebody else knows better
[438.96s - 444.64s] than me for me or that, you know, I'm an idiot or I'm not worthwhile or anything that... I guess I had
[444.64s - 450.32s] the benefit of I grew up with a lot of love. Like the people around me love me unconditionally. And so
[450.32s - 455.12s] that just gave me a lot of confidence. Not the kind of confidence that would say I have the answer,
[455.70s - 461.12s] but the kind of confidence that I will figure it out and I know what I want. Or only I am a good
[461.12s - 462.26s] arbiter of what I want.

  “But…” [408.20s], “And…” multiple places, “Yes and no.” [427.20s]), or relies on pronouns/ellipses like “it,” “yourself,”

Chunk 3 Transcript:
[462.26s - 468.12s] Yeah. That level of self-belief, I suppose, allows you to determine what is it that matters
[468.12s - 473.60s] to me, my self-esteem. Should I chase this thing or not? I can make a fair judgment on that as
[473.60s - 478.90s] opposed to being so swayed. But it's such a good point about even if you think you're not consciously
[478.90s - 484.46s] logging the stuff that you're doing, there is some that's in the back of your mind. Was it the
[484.46s - 487.98s] daemon? Is that what the ancient Greeks or something used to talk about?
[487.98s - 493.96s] Yeah. Also in computer science, there's a concept of a daemon, which is a program that's
[493.96s - 498.74s] always running in the background. You can't see it. But yeah, it probably comes from the ancient
[498.74s - 506.48s] Greek daemon. But yeah, what you know that you don't even know you know is far greater than what
[506.48s - 511.76s] you know you know. You can't even articulate most of the things you know. There are feelings you have
[511.76s - 517.12s] that have no words for them. There are thoughts you have that are felt within the body or subconsciously
[517.12s - 521.94s] that you never articulate to yourself. You can't articulate the rules of grammar, yet you
[521.94s - 527.62s] exercise them effortlessly when you speak. So I would argue that your implicit knowledge and your
[527.62s - 531.32s] knowledge that is unknown to yourself is far greater than the knowledge you can articulate and
[531.32s - 537.28s] that you can communicate. And so at some level, you're always watching yourself. That's what your
[537.28s - 540.84s] consciousness is, right? It's the thing that's watching everything, including your mind, including
[540.84s - 547.76s] your body. So if you want to have high self-esteem, then earn your own self-respect.
[548.66s - 553.70s] I had this idea, the internal golden rule. So the golden rule says treat others the way that
[553.70s - 558.34s] you should be treated, you want to be treated. The internal golden rule says treat yourself like others
[558.34s - 565.60s] should have treated you. And it was a riposte to maybe people that didn't grow up with
[565.60s - 571.22s] unconditional love in that way. On the love thing, one of the interesting things about love is
[571.22s - 577.62s] you can try to remember the feeling of being loved. So go back to when someone was in love with you or
[577.62s - 582.32s] someone did love you. And like really remember that feeling, like really sit with it and try to
[582.32s - 589.64s] recreate it within yourself. And then go to the feeling of you loving someone. And when you were in
[589.64s - 593.36s] love, and I'm not even talking about romantic love necessarily. So be a little careful there. I'm talking
[593.36s - 597.58s] more about like love for it. Sometimes get complex if you're talking about past romantic love. Right.
[597.68s - 603.72s] A sibling or a child or something like that, or a parent. And think about when you felt love
[603.72s - 610.82s] towards someone or something. And now which is better? And I would argue that the feeling of being
[610.82s - 615.52s] in love is actually more exhilarating than the feeling of being loved. Being loved is a little
[615.52s - 619.52s] cloying. It's a little too sweet. You kind of want to push the person away. It's a little embarrassing.
[619.52s - 623.52s] And you know that if that person is too much into it, that you feel constrained.
[623.72s - 628.26s] On the other hand, the feeling of being in love is very expansive. It's very open. It actually makes
[628.26s - 632.98s] you a better version of yourself. It makes you want to be a better person. And so you can create
[632.98s - 636.58s] love anytime you want. It's just that craving to receive it. That's the problem.
[636.84s - 642.10s] I went to this daytime house music party in Austin on Saturday. It's called Mushroom Cowboy.
[642.76s - 643.88s] So it's a...
[643.88s - 644.82s] Microdosed kind of event?
[644.82s - 648.66s] I don't know. I think they're kind of hinting at that, but it's in a coffee... Well, it was
[648.66s - 650.16s] outside of a coffee shop off Congress.
[650.46s - 650.64s] Yeah.
[650.76s - 657.66s] So I turn up at half 10. It started at 10. And the queue is 250 yards long for coffee.
[657.98s - 658.32s] What?
[658.58s - 663.88s] And there must have been 1,500 people there. One guy brought a baguette, was raving with
[663.88s - 668.84s] his baguette. There was dogs, you know, pretty sober looking from the outside. Maybe some people
[668.84s - 676.48s] smoking weed. But I think this is maybe the beginning of us seeing the end of, like, hardcore
[676.48s - 683.48s] drink culture. If you've looked at how few of Gen Z now drink, it's, I think, maybe 20%.
[683.48s - 689.08s] The interesting thing is, like, the theories on why. Because there's obviously... They have

  Decision: SAVE exactly one passage: the segment that builds to “So if you want to have high self-esteem, then earn your
  own self-respect.” from [498.74s - 547.76s]. It starts cleanly (no “And”), delivers a compelling insight about implicit

thought: 'Intent: The chunk mixes reflection on implicit knowledge/consciousness, a brief maxim about self-esteem, an “internal
  golden rule” concept, a long love/feeling exercise, and then a casual party anecdote.

  Decision: REJECT the chunk (no passage saved).

  Justification:

  - The strongest maxim (“So if you want to have high self-esteem, then earn your own self-respect.”) is embedded in [540.84s
  - 547.76s] but the line begins with a dangling fragment (“your body.”), making the opener abrupt and context‑dependent—fails
  Standalone/Hook.

  - The “internal golden rule” idea spans [548.66s - 565.60s]; to be complete it requires [565.60s - 571.22s] to finish the
  sentence (“…unconditional love in that way.”), but that same line immediately launches a new clause (“On the love thing…”)
  causing a trailing, non‑closing ending. Any shorter cut ends mid‑sentence—fails Standalone/Closure and Timestamp integrity
  constraints.

  - The love sequence (starting ~[571.22s]) forms a solid arc only if continued through [632.98s - 636.58s], but that full
  span is ~65.36s (>60s). Trimming to fit introduces openings with fragments (“towards someone or something.”), context‑dependent
  connectors (“On the other hand”), or ends mid‑thought—fails Length/Standalone/Hook.

  - Remaining lines are conversational, technical (daemon), or anecdotal (party/drinking) and lack a clear motivational insight
  with a clean, standalone arc.

  Given default precision bias and the ≥95% confidence requirement, no segment meets all gates (Standalone, Impact, Hook,
  Length, Timestamp integrity). Confirmed that attempting to save any would either start mid‑thought, end without closure,
  exceed 60s, or violate verbatim/timestamp rules.'
code: 'final_answer(answer="Nothing saved. All candidate segments fail standalone/timestamp criteria: 1) The self-esteem maxim

  spans lines that either end mid-sentence if cut or include a new unfinished clause when extended ([548.66s-571.22s]), breaking
  closure. 3) The love arc exceeds 60s when complete ([571.22s-636.58s]); shorter trims open with fragments/contextual connectors

Chunk 4 Transcript:
[689.08s - 696.80s] to be theories, right? On... We don't actually know exactly. Yeah. One of them is that people,
[697.74s - 703.58s] the youth views drinking as, like, what their parents did, right? So that's like...
[703.58s - 704.58s] Naturally uncool.
[704.58s - 710.72s] Yeah. My fucking lame-ass dad drinks. Like, I don't... I'm not interested. And so that's
[710.72s - 719.42s] one thing. The other part of it is that this, uh, group of people, uh, that are the youth
[719.42s - 726.92s] right now are so much more informed on what the negative aspects of drinking and what it
[726.92s - 732.38s] can do to you, that they're just like, why would I, you know, why would I object to something
[732.38s - 737.96s] like that? And that they've found this whole other, you know, when you want to take the edge
[737.96s - 745.08s] off, there's a lot more options. And it's also a lot more accepted today than it was 20 years ago.
[745.16s - 749.50s] Like, the idea that you could microdose or do edibles or smoke, or, you know what I mean? And
[749.50s - 754.18s] then there's, like, all the, you know, ketamine and everything is, like, I have different things
[754.18s - 760.56s] that I do when I want to have a recreational good time. Um, and yeah, but it's undeniable that
[760.56s - 761.86s] it's definitely way down.
[761.86s - 767.06s] There's more daily users in the U.S. of weed now than there are of alcohol.
[767.06s - 768.14s] Is that for real?
[768.30s - 771.88s] Overtaken. Or at least that was the most recent study that I saw. In the U.S. they're now more
[771.88s - 775.80s] daily or near daily marijuana users than daily or near daily alcohol users.
[776.16s - 781.10s] And that, and that, that thought was just completely, like, if you're a teen right now,
[781.10s - 786.92s] you don't understand how preposterous that sounds coming from, like, if you were growing
[786.92s - 792.26s] up in the eighties and nineties, like you were just like, that, those were like the fringe
[792.26s - 797.04s] people almost, you know what I mean? Like, yes, it was popular, but it was not like,
[797.04s - 802.08s] like a respectable person really wasn't doing that. You know, it was like the arts, it was
[802.08s - 808.54s] like hippies and, and yeah, it was, I mean, people thought of it as like the absolute worst
[808.54s - 814.54s] thing that could happen. I mean, people from like my dad's generation likened marijuana
[814.54s - 818.08s] to heroin. They didn't even see like really a difference. They're just like, you're a junkie.
[818.08s - 822.28s] It's like, but for smoking a joint and like, yeah, that's the way they viewed it. So the
[822.28s - 826.60s] fact that it's that accepted now, it's, it's mind blowing to me.
[826.60s - 832.72s] I wonder if some of it is that drinking in the house on your own feels pretty fucking
[832.72s - 833.36s] bad. Yeah.
[833.64s - 836.52s] Smoking in the house on your own. You're like, I'm just watching, I'm playing Call of Duty.
[836.58s - 841.28s] Yeah. Leave me alone. But if you, if you're six beers deep playing Call of Duty, it's a
[841.28s - 841.94s] different story.
[842.02s - 844.62s] Yeah. And you're not playing well at that. You're just like,
[844.66s - 847.24s] I don't know how well people are playing on weed either, but yeah.
[852.28s - 859.22s] Um, yeah, I think that, um, I mean, look, smoke, smoking is still not good for you. So
[859.22s - 864.58s] like you're probably, but, but we've discovered that, you know, there's other ways to ingest
[864.58s - 868.82s] and like consume. And that's, I, that's what I think is part of like this youth culture
[868.82s - 873.12s] thing about staying away from drinking is they're like, whatever I do droplets in this
[873.12s - 877.60s] or I, you know, I, I have my gummy or whatever, however they want to consume, but they're just,
[877.60s - 881.46s] they're definitely not drinking, man. They're not drinking like they, like everybody else
[881.46s - 885.76s] before them did. I used to run nightclubs for ages. And one of the big downturns we've
[885.76s - 889.80s] seen has been in nightlife industry. I think the UK is losing a nightclub a week. There's
[889.80s - 892.82s] not like an unlimited number of nightclubs. It's like one is shutting down pretty much
[892.82s - 896.60s] every single week. And I asked a friend who's still in the industry, why he thought that
[896.60s - 900.70s] was the case. And he said, smartphones, man, back in the day, you could be as loose as
[900.70s - 905.78s] you wanted. You could sort of have that Larry, louty drinking spirit, at least in, in
[905.78s - 909.82s] Britain. They don't want to be recorded. Of course. Like if you mess up and like
[909.82s - 915.52s] shit yourself in the middle of a nightclub in 2002, it's a story that you can deny the
[915.52s - 919.50s] next day. And then after six months, most people have probably forgotten. Whereas if

[919.50s - 924.74s] that happens in 2025, that's now concretized on the internet for everybody to know and bring
[924.74s - 926.64s] back up and make memes out of for the rest of time.
[926.64s - 931.60s] I mean, it's, but can you imagine like how the pro athletes of the eighties and nineties
[931.60s - 942.53s] and early two thousands would just go out and just, just destroy, just destroy a woman's
[942.53s - 947.63s] hopes and dreams. And then now they're all, yeah. They're like, everyone's on edge.
[947.89s - 953.49s] Yeah. Everyone's got a phone out. It's just, yeah, it's, it's a totally different, by the
[953.49s - 958.93s] way, do you ever think about why, as I still remember that, like, why was house music and
[958.93s - 965.35s] dancing in general so much bigger in Europe than here? People here were never like, let's go dance.
[965.99s - 970.27s] I'm not sure. I mean, I guess why does any scene of any kind appear anywhere? We certainly have in
[970.27s - 976.77s] the UK, like a good house music culture. Yeah. Uh, a lot of people didn't have much else to do
[976.77s - 980.43s] other than go out and party and drink. Yeah. If the weather's bad, then, you know, we're not going
[980.43s - 985.45s] to go out to the ranch. We're not going to go and see the sunset. We're not going to go to the
[985.45s - 990.03s] beach because it's fucking freezing cold all the time. So you kind of just zero in on the one thing
[990.03s - 996.15s] that's reliable, which is beer. Yeah. Pubs or clubs. Yeah. Yeah. No, I just remember like so many times
[996.15s - 1001.35s] like being in the States and having like European friends are like, why don't you guys, you guys
[1001.35s - 1008.39s] don't like to go dance? And I was like, no, no, we're not going dancing, bro. Like, no. And, and then I
[1008.39s - 1012.23s] would remember like studying abroad and being like, oh yeah, we would, that's, that was like a normal
[1012.23s - 1017.49s] thing. You just go to a place that was just like packed and everybody just loud music dancing. It
[1017.49s - 1020.81s] just was one of those things where I was like, it just didn't translate over here. I mean, there's
[1020.81s - 1026.59s] still clubs obviously, but it just wasn't the same type of, oh, I just want to go listen to this and
[1026.59s - 1032.35s] literally dance. Like that's what people I felt like were doing a lot more in Europe than here.
[1033.45s - 1038.33s] These are the three decisions that I think everyone makes every moment. First, you're doing it right
[1038.33s - 1043.25s] now. What are you going to focus on? You're going to be focusing on my story I'm telling you. You're
[1043.25s - 1045.85s] going to be focusing on the next question you're going to ask. You're going to be focusing on how
[1045.85s - 1050.43s] your stomach feels. If you've not eaten, there's a million things you could focus on literally,
[1050.43s - 1056.47s] but we don't experience life. We experience the part of life we focus on. And so the bottom line is
[1056.47s - 1060.95s] I know my father and I had a different experience because we had different focuses that I was focused
[1060.95s - 1065.33s] on his food. You know, what a concept. This is cool. He was focused on that he had not taken care
[1065.33s - 1070.73s] of his family. And I know that because, you know, he said it about 20 times under his breath
[1070.73s - 1075.87s] and my mother echoed it, of course. Um, the second decision though, the minute you focus on
[1075.87s - 1080.85s] something, your brain has to decide what does it mean? And meaning is what creates emotion and
[1080.85s - 1085.97s] emotion is where your life is. Right. And so the quality of your life is the quality of your
[1085.97s - 1090.95s] emotions. If you had a billion dollars in every day, you're pissed off and angry. Your life's
[1090.95s - 1094.45s] quality is called pissed off and angry. If you've got three beautiful children or husband or wife,
[1094.45s - 1102.03s] you love, but you worry all the time, your life is worry. You know? So his focus and then his
[1102.03s - 1107.09s] meaning, that was the worst part. The meaning he gave it was that he was worthless and didn't belong
[1107.09s - 1112.73s] here. And that usually leads to the third decision, which is what are you going to do? And like,
[1112.75s - 1117.37s] if you think if the meaning is something happens, you say this person is dissing me, you know,
[1117.37s - 1124.03s] disrespecting me, or is this person challenging me? Or is this person coaching me? Or is this person
[1124.03s - 1127.79s] loving me? If you think they're dissing you, you're going to have a very different emotional
[1127.79s - 1131.95s] reaction than if you think they're coaching you or loving you. And then of course, that's going to
[1131.95s - 1134.71s] change what decision you make. Because if you're angry, you're going to make a different decision
