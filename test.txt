[1038.54s - 1039.66s] Gifted to be successful
[1039.66s - 1040.86s] If they don't
[1040.86s - 1041.74s] Have persistence
[1041.74s - 1043.62s] So if you feel
[1043.62s - 1044.52s] Like your talents
[1044.52s - 1045.44s] Had a 5 out of 10
[1045.44s - 1046.76s] Yeah you should
[1046.76s - 1047.30s] Work on it
[1047.30s - 1048.22s] For sure you should
[1048.22s - 1048.70s] Build it
[1048.70s - 1049.82s] But if your
[1049.82s - 1051.18s] Consistency is at a
[1051.18s - 1051.86s] 10 out of 10
[1051.86s - 1053.12s] That's going to
[1053.12s - 1053.86s] Average out as
[1053.86s - 1054.66s] 7 and a half
[1054.66s - 1055.70s] But let's say
[1055.70s - 1056.42s] Someone's talent
[1056.42s - 1057.66s] Is a 9 out of 10
[1057.66s - 1058.88s] But their commitment
[1058.88s - 1060.16s] Their consistency
[1060.16s - 1061.32s] Is a 2 out of 10
[1061.32s - 1062.66s] Well then you're
[1062.66s - 1063.16s] Going to break that
[1063.16s - 1064.28s] Down to a
[1064.28s - 1065.12s] 5 and a half
[1065.12s - 1066.78s] They're 2 points
[1066.78s - 1067.64s] Behind you
[1067.64s - 1068.74s] Because of the
[1068.74s - 1069.24s] Average
[1069.24s - 1070.60s] So stop
[1070.60s - 1071.30s] Waiting
[1071.30s - 1072.60s] To feel good
[1072.60s - 1072.98s] Enough
[1072.98s - 1073.98s] Stop waiting
[1073.98s - 1074.82s] To feel talented
[1074.82s - 1075.28s] Enough
[1075.28s - 1076.22s] Stop waiting
[1076.22s - 1076.88s] To feel
[1076.88s - 1077.50s] Like you're
[1077.50s - 1077.92s] The best
[1077.92s - 1078.54s] In the game
[1078.54s - 1079.26s] There's a
[1079.26s - 1079.88s] Beautiful quote
[1079.88s - 1080.86s] By Zig Ziglar
[1080.86s - 1081.98s] That I love
[1081.98s - 1083.16s] You don't
[1083.16s - 1083.70s] Have to be
[1083.70s - 1084.80s] Great to start
[1084.80s - 1086.12s] But you have
[1086.12s - 1086.66s] To start
[1086.66s - 1087.30s] To be great
[1087.30s - 1088.16s] Right
[1088.16s - 1088.68s] This idea
[1088.68s - 1089.12s] That I have
[1089.12s - 1089.72s] To be great
[1089.72s - 1090.34s] When I start
[1090.34s - 1091.04s] I have to have
[1091.04s - 1091.74s] A video
[1091.74s - 1092.58s] That goes viral
[1092.58s - 1093.34s] I have to have
[1093.34s - 1093.72s] A book
[1093.72s - 1094.34s] That sells
[1094.34s - 1095.54s] A million copies
[1095.54s - 1096.58s] Right off the bat
[1096.58s - 1097.88s] That's the pressure
[1097.88s - 1098.32s] We're putting
[1098.32s - 1099.02s] On ourselves
[1099.02s - 1100.20s] And we're all
[1100.20s - 1101.32s] Becoming paralyzed
[1101.32s - 1102.88s] By the pressure
[1102.88s - 1104.36s] Of perfection
[1104.36s - 1105.76s] Instead of
[1105.76s - 1106.70s] Making progress
[1106.70s - 1108.22s] And being consistent
[1108.22s - 1109.38s] And finding
[1109.38s - 1109.98s] Our genius
[1109.98s - 1110.58s] Within that
[1110.58s - 1111.38s] One thing
[1111.38s - 1112.02s] I want to address
[1112.02s - 1113.06s] Here is
[1113.06s - 1113.96s] This myth
[1113.96s - 1114.92s] Of
[1114.92s - 1115.80s] You missed
[1115.80s - 1116.56s] Your window
[1116.56s - 1117.46s] How many times
[1117.46s - 1117.78s] Have you ever
[1117.78s - 1118.38s] Had that experience
[1118.38s - 1118.86s] And you feel
[1118.86s - 1120.64s] I missed my chance
[1120.64s - 1122.18s] That could have
[1122.18s - 1122.50s] Been me
[1122.50s - 1124.18s] I could have
[1124.18s - 1124.56s] Been happily
[1124.56s - 1125.12s] Married now
[1125.12s - 1126.94s] I should have
[1126.94s - 1127.56s] Had that career
[1127.56s - 1130.42s] I missed my time
[1130.42s - 1131.66s] Didn't work
[1131.66s - 1133.92s] I just
[1133.92s - 1136.36s] I wish I didn't
[1136.36s - 1137.26s] I wish I didn't
[1137.26s - 1137.82s] Give up then
[1137.82s - 1139.46s] Here's the truth
[1139.46s - 1141.48s] That was the myth
[1141.48s - 1144.26s] Life rarely moves
[1144.26s - 1145.44s] In straight lines
[1145.44s - 1147.54s] There are always
[1147.54s - 1148.82s] New entry points
[1148.82s - 1150.18s] A Yale study
[1150.18s - 1151.74s] On non-linear careers
[1151.74s - 1152.90s] Found that people
[1152.90s - 1153.52s] Who start
[1153.52s - 1154.56s] Later in life
[1154.56s - 1156.24s] Often outperform
[1156.24s - 1157.48s] Early starters
[1157.48s - 1158.76s] In long term
[1158.76s - 1159.56s] Fulfillment
[1159.56s - 1160.66s] And career
[1160.66s - 1161.54s] Satisfaction
[1161.54s - 1162.94s] You didn't
[1162.94s - 1163.90s] Miss your shot
[1163.90s - 1165.14s] You just
[1165.14s - 1165.88s] Needed to stop
[1165.88s - 1166.48s] Aiming
[1166.48s - 1167.60s] At someone
[1167.60s - 1168.34s] Else's
[1168.34s - 1169.10s] Timeline
[1169.10s - 1170.82s] Think about that
[1170.82s - 1171.88s] You didn't
[1171.88s - 1172.74s] Miss your shot
[1172.74s - 1173.76s] You just
[1173.76s - 1174.70s] Needed to stop
[1174.70s - 1175.36s] Aiming
[1175.36s - 1176.30s] At someone
[1176.30s - 1176.90s] Else's
[1176.90s - 1177.44s] Timeline
[1177.44s - 1178.44s] You didn't
[1178.44s - 1178.80s] Miss your
[1178.80s - 1179.42s] Chance
[1179.42s - 1180.66s] You just
[1180.66s - 1181.08s] Needed to
[1181.08s - 1182.10s] Stop focusing
[1182.10s - 1183.44s] On someone
[1183.44s - 1183.94s] Else's
[1183.94s - 1184.54s] Deadline
[1184.54s - 1185.96s] You didn't
[1185.96s - 1186.48s] Miss your
[1186.48s - 1187.34s] Opportunity
[1187.34s - 1188.82s] You just
[1188.82s - 1189.24s] Needed to
[1189.24s - 1190.04s] Stop focusing
[1190.04s - 1191.22s] On other
[1191.22s - 1191.82s] People's
[1191.82s - 1192.28s] Doors
[1192.28s - 1193.36s] One of my
[1193.36s - 1194.26s] Favorite quotes
[1194.26s - 1195.02s] Is from
[1195.02s - 1195.48s] Imam
[1195.48s - 1196.24s] Al-Shafi
[1196.24s - 1197.72s] He said
[1197.72s - 1198.78s] My heart
[1198.78s - 1199.60s] Is at ease
[1199.60s - 1200.86s] Knowing what
[1200.86s - 1201.42s] Was meant
[1201.42s - 1201.92s] For me
[1201.92s - 1202.82s] Will never
[1202.82s - 1203.38s] Miss me
[1203.38s - 1204.66s] And that
[1204.66s - 1205.34s] Which misses
[1205.34s - 1205.66s] Me
[1205.66s - 1206.72s] Was never
[1206.72s - 1207.42s] Meant for me
[1207.44s - 1208.70s] What missed
[1208.70s - 1208.88s] You
[1208.88s - 1209.26s] Was never
[1209.26s - 1209.84s] For you
[1209.84s - 1211.00s] And what
[1211.00s - 1211.44s] Is for
[1211.44s - 1211.78s] You
[1211.78s - 1212.88s] Will never
[1212.88s - 1214.00s] Miss you
[1214.00s - 1215.06s] We have
[1215.06s - 1215.72s] To recognize
[1215.72s - 1216.94s] That where
[1216.94s - 1217.54s] We are
[1217.54s - 1218.60s] And what
[1218.60s - 1218.82s] We've
[1218.82s - 1219.58s] Experienced
[1219.58s - 1220.24s] And the
[1220.24s - 1220.58s] Talents
[1220.58s - 1220.84s] And the
[1220.84s - 1221.36s] Skills you
[1221.36s - 1221.58s] Have
[1221.58s - 1221.80s] And the
[1221.80s - 1222.30s] Resilience
[1222.30s - 1222.56s] You have
[1222.56s - 1222.78s] And the
[1222.78s - 1223.00s] Grit
[1223.00s - 1223.50s] You have
[1223.50s - 1224.50s] Is the
[1224.50s - 1225.24s] Exact
[1225.24s - 1225.82s] Cocktail
[1225.82s - 1226.74s] That you
[1226.74s - 1227.20s] Need
[1227.20s - 1228.14s] To create
[1228.14s - 1228.56s] The future
[1228.56s - 1228.86s] That you
[1228.86s - 1229.10s] Want
[1229.10s - 1229.90s] So
[1229.90s - 1230.76s] I want
[1230.76s - 1231.00s] You to
[1231.00s - 1231.34s] Start
[1231.34s - 1232.08s] Labeling
[1232.08s - 1232.78s] The fog
[1232.78s - 1233.88s] Differently
[1233.88s - 1235.50s] Name what's
[1235.50s - 1236.04s] Actually
[1236.04s - 1236.56s] Missing
[1236.56s - 1237.72s] People
[1237.72s - 1238.12s] Say
[1238.12s - 1238.88s] I feel
[1238.88s - 1239.54s] Stuck
[1239.54s - 1240.68s] But what
[1240.68s - 1241.12s] They really
[1241.12s - 1241.78s] Mean is
[1241.78s - 1242.36s] I'm
[1242.36s - 1243.20s] Overwhelmed
[1243.20s - 1243.84s] I'm
[1243.84s - 1244.16s] Afraid
[1244.16s - 1244.42s] To
[1244.42s - 1244.78s] Fail
[1244.78s - 1245.50s] I'm
[1245.50s - 1246.06s] Comparing
[1246.06s - 1246.58s] Myself
[1246.58s - 1246.74s] To
[1246.74s - 1247.06s] Everyone
[1247.06s - 1247.42s] Right
[1247.42s - 1247.58s] I'm
[1247.58s - 1247.70s] Sure
[1247.70s - 1247.94s] You can
[1247.94s - 1248.26s] Relate
[1248.26s - 1249.56s] The process
[1249.56s - 1249.80s] Of
[1249.80s - 1250.32s] Affect
[1250.32s - 1251.04s] Labeling
[1251.04s - 1251.84s] Shows
[1251.84s - 1252.58s] That naming
[1252.58s - 1253.40s] Emotions
[1253.40s - 1254.34s] Reduces
[1254.34s - 1254.98s] Activity
[1254.98s - 1255.70s] In the
[1255.70s - 1256.34s] Amygdala
[1256.34s - 1257.68s] And restores
[1257.68s - 1258.58s] Prefrontal
[1258.58s - 1259.06s] Cortex
[1259.06s - 1259.64s] Function
[1259.64s - 1260.54s] A.K.A.
[1260.56s - 1260.84s] Clear
[1260.84s - 1261.28s] Thinking
[1261.28s - 1262.32s] So here's
[1262.32s - 1262.68s] What I want
[1262.68s - 1262.88s] You to
[1262.88s - 1263.02s] Do
[1263.02s - 1263.34s] Today
[1263.34s - 1264.30s] Open
[1264.30s - 1264.52s] Your

[1264.84s - 1265.10s] App
[1265.10s - 1265.34s] Or
[1265.34s - 1265.74s] Journal
[1265.74s - 1266.74s] And complete
[1266.74s - 1267.48s] The sentence
[1267.48s - 1268.30s] Right
[1268.30s - 1268.72s] Now
[1268.72s - 1269.48s] I feel
[1269.48s - 1270.14s] Stuck
[1270.14s - 1271.00s] Because
[1271.00s - 1272.56s] Then ask
[1272.56s - 1273.24s] Is this
[1273.24s - 1273.48s] About
[1273.48s - 1274.00s] Clarity
[1274.00s - 1275.18s] Confidence
[1275.18s - 1275.48s] Or
[1275.48s - 1275.96s] Control
[1275.96s - 1277.28s] You can't
[1277.28s - 1277.76s] Fix
[1277.76s - 1278.34s] What you
[1278.34s - 1278.66s] Won't
[1278.66s - 1279.10s] Name
[1279.10s - 1279.64s] So when
[1279.64s - 1279.92s] We say
[1279.92s - 1280.14s] Things
[1280.14s - 1280.28s] Like
[1280.28s - 1280.40s] I'm
[1280.40s - 1280.56s] Just
[1280.56s - 1280.94s] Stuck
[1280.94s - 1282.12s] Imagine
[1282.12s - 1282.40s] You
[1282.40s - 1282.56s] Were
[1282.56s - 1282.84s] Driving
[1282.84s - 1283.08s] Down
[1283.08s - 1283.22s] A
[1283.22s - 1283.44s] Road
[1283.44s - 1284.68s] And
[1284.68s - 1285.34s] Your
[1285.34s - 1285.86s] Maps
[1285.86s - 1286.08s] Went
[1286.08s - 1286.30s] Off
