# GitHub Copilot Instructions for My Project

**General Guidelines:**

- Always consider the libraries and frameworks listed in `requirements.txt` and their installed versions.  
- Ensure that any suggested code is fully compatible with the versions installed in the project.  
- Example: If `moviepy` version 2.0.0 is installed, do **not** suggest functions or parameters introduced in version 2.1 or later.  
- Avoid using deprecated methods or APIs that are not available in the installed versions.  
- Suggest code that works with the project's Python version and other dependencies.  

-   Always use Python 3.9 or higher.
-   Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code.
-   Prioritize clear and concise code over overly complex solutions.
-   Write comprehensive unit tests for all new functions and classes.
