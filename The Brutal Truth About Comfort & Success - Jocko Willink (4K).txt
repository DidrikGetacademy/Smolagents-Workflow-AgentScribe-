[0.00s - 17.22s] There's going to be things in your life that you don't have control over human beings can control a lot more than they think they can and often times it's pretty easy just to say oh that's not me that's not on me and people say that's not my fault there's nothing I can do about that and more often than people think there is something you can do about it and it is your fault.
[20.94s - 38.07s] Jocker willing to look at the show thanks for having me appreciate it you flew to watch the UFC with Cam Haynes and Chris Pratt I want to know what a night out with Jocker willing looks like watch I didn't fly up there with Cam Cam was already up there.
[38.07s - 64.07s] I think he flew in from Oregon where he is where he lives but we did we did meet up there and but I did fly up there with Chris Pratt and Jack Carr and some of the other folks from the terminal list which is a TV show that Chris Pratt is in that Jack Carr wrote the book that the show is based on and we went up there watch the fights it was a very cool night yeah it was fun.
[65.07s - 66.07s] What time did you get up the next day.
[67.58s - 82.58s] I got up I don't know but Cam was giving me a hard time he says what you know what are you are you gonna get up tomorrow morning and I said I'm not even gonna get home until three in the morning and that's right that's when I got home I got home at three o'clock in the morning I think I got up around maybe eight eight thirty something like that.
[83.58s - 87.58s] The fact that you don't do the 430 am thing after a night out makes me feel at least a little bit more mortal.
[88.58s - 92.58s] If it's gonna be less than four hours of sleep then I'll make some kind of adjustment.
[92.58s - 96.58s] You'll just push it the next day yeah what was it like to see the UFC live have you seen that before.
[97.58s - 108.58s] I've been to so many UFC's I don't know how many I've been to but I've been to a lot I spent I when I was younger I spent a lot of time coaching and training fighters so I corner I've cornered a bunch of fighters in the UFC.
[109.58s - 120.58s] And so I've been to I don't even know how many UFC's I've been to but I haven't been in a long time I haven't been in probably three four years so it was cool to go and see one again and get back up there.
[120.58s - 136.58s] The UFC seeing the UFC live is is awesome and look you know people will say and even I'll say this too it's great to sit at home and you know get all the different angles and hear the commentary that that's cool.
[137.58s - 144.58s] There's there's a benefit to that but there is a lot of a lot of hype and a lot of energy that that's in the room or in the in the stadium when it's going on.
[145.58s - 154.74s] And so being there live definitely definitely is is worth doing occasionally to make sure you don't forget what that what that's all about.
[155.74s - 157.74s] How do you handle the next day now if you've had a few drinks the night before.
[158.74s - 170.74s] I actually don't drink so you know that's really no factor for me you know I drank I drank more than my fair share when I was in the military and then when I retired from the military and I kind of just.
[171.74s - 187.00s] Over time over over time I just kind of wasn't drinking anymore now I just don't really drink anymore there's not much in it for me you know I'm a I'm a old man with I'm married with kids and businesses and all this other stuff going on so I'm not going to get much out of out of drinking anymore.
[188.00s - 191.00s] And a big price to pay the next day as well if you did decide to do it maybe.
[192.00s - 199.12s] I guess I sure I guess that that might be some of it but there's just I just don't I'm not going to anything out of it.
[200.12s - 206.12s] So two of the biggest elements in your life have been your military training and your martial arts training.
[207.48s - 215.48s] What would you say are the commonalities between the best BJJ athletes and the best special forces operators that you've worked with.
[217.08s - 227.08s] There's probably the biggest commonality between the two is some kind of strange contrast between being extremely disciplined and being extremely creative.
[227.08s - 238.08s] So clearly if you're going to get good at jujitsu you got to be the you got to be disciplined enough to train all the time same thing with being in the military if you're going to be a good operator you have to have the discipline to push yourself in training.
[239.08s - 250.08s] But you can't be a person that you know lean so hard towards a disciplined structured life that you don't have any creativity because both in jujitsu and on the battlefield you want to.
[251.08s - 259.08s] You definitely want to have be creative and figure out creative solutions and things that people haven't thought of and things that the enemy is not going to think of or that your opponents not going to think of.
[260.08s - 268.08s] So you got to find that person who has a good balance between discipline and kind of a wild freedom creativity that they can make adjustments.
[269.08s - 277.14s] It's interesting to think that more focus or more efficiency isn't always the solution to everything.
[278.14s - 286.14s] So I the analogy I'd use is if you think about an artist's creative studio where they need their creativity.
[287.14s - 295.17s] It's not orderly you know there's half coffees and easels and sketches and paint and all sorts of stuff all over it.
[296.17s - 305.17s] What does that engender what's that environment creating for them but then when they need to go and file their taxes trying to file their taxes in that same room is probably not a good idea.
[305.17s - 315.17s] And I guess that flip flop between off and on right between focus and play it seems like a very interesting thing to think about especially in a military context.
[316.17s - 320.17s] What does that mean when you're talking about a special forces operator being creative.
[321.17s - 335.45s] You know there's a certain level of inside the military in general is if you're going to you have to be a person that kind of follows the rules and stays within standards and that's great.
[336.45s - 341.87s] And you're going to you're going to be a good solid soldier if that's what you are.
[342.87s - 353.32s] But if you have a mindset that's that's so highly disciplined so highly structured like I just said then you're not going to think creatively when there's a problem that needs to be solved.
[354.32s - 364.32s] So you want to have people that don't mind the discipline and can actually access the disc discipline in a way that they can utilize it but you don't want people to be trapped by discipline.
[364.32s - 374.32s] And it's the same thing in Jiu Jitsu if you have someone that only knows how to do a certain move and they can't think creatively about other ways to employ that.
[375.32s - 377.32s] It's not that they're not going to be good because they are going to be good.
[378.32s - 380.64s] But there's going to they're going to reach limitations.
[381.64s - 389.37s] And you know one of the interesting things in the SEAL teams is we didn't have especially when I was coming up we didn't have any doctrine whatsoever.
[390.37s - 392.37s] There was no there was no written doctrine of any kind.
[392.37s - 394.37s] So everything that you learned was word of mouth.
[395.37s - 397.37s] You learned from the guys that went before you.
[398.37s - 402.37s] And that meant if the guys that went before you weren't didn't really know what they were doing you're probably learning a bad way.
[403.37s - 410.37s] And if you didn't think if you didn't think objectively about it then you might follow someone down a path that doesn't make any sense.
[411.37s - 417.37s] So you ended up with a bunch of guys in the SEAL teams that were pretty open minded and they could kind of look at problems and figure out how to solve them.
[417.37s - 421.37s] In the Army and the Marine Corps they have doctrine for just about everything.
[422.37s - 423.37s] This is how you do a raid.
[423.37s - 424.37s] This is how you conduct an ambush.
[424.37s - 425.37s] They had written doctrine for this.
[426.37s - 430.37s] So if you didn't know how you could just look at a book which is actually a huge benefit for them.
[431.37s - 437.37s] Because if I'm a new platoon commander not on how don't know how to do an ambush I can just look at this book and I can learn how to do it.
[438.37s - 442.37s] So there's some huge benefits to not to having a very disciplined doctrine that you can follow.
[442.37s - 455.37s] But that's one of the odd advantages of the SEAL teams is that since we didn't have any doctrine we had to be a little bit more free thinking and that made us a little bit more adaptive in in some situations.
[456.37s - 464.37s] So it's just like anything else your strength can be your weakness your weakness can be your strength and you have to be aware and if you're aware that it's a strength and if you're aware that it can also be a weakness.
[465.37s - 474.37s] And if you're aware that it's a weakness and you're aware that it can also be a strength then you can probably optimize the way that you're going to think which is pretty beneficial.
[475.37s - 477.37s] Do you think that can be trained that creativity.
[478.47s - 483.98s] Yeah I think creativity can be trained just like any other natural trait.
[484.98s - 491.98s] Some people are going to have more propensity to be creative than someone else and some people are more rigid than other people in the way they think.
[491.98s - 494.98s] And you can take someone that's more rigid and you can make them more creative.
[495.98s - 505.14s] But everyone's going to have some kind of a limitation and some people might have a pretty pretty pretty subdued limitation of how creative they're going to get.
[506.14s - 508.14s] And some people can really be trained to get a lot better at that.
[509.14s - 510.14s] Where did you fall on that spectrum.
[511.14s - 519.87s] I would say I fell I would say I fell pretty hard in both directions.
[520.87s - 530.87s] So I was you know a disciplined person that believed in structure and I liked structure and at the same time you know I was I would definitely think of things in a different way.
[531.87s - 540.87s] I was a very rebellious kid and I think rebellion could be somehow tied to creativity and looking at things and saying hey that doesn't make sense to me.
[541.87s - 548.87s] So I'd say that I had I had say I was pretty a pretty strong degree of both of those things and that's what made me who I am.
[549.87s - 551.87s] Well especially the music that you listen to as well growing up right.
[552.87s - 561.32s] I don't think almost all of the kids that I know that grow up listening to metal or hardcore they've you can't listen to that and not have a rebellious streak in you.
[562.32s - 571.32s] Yeah you definitely can't listen to that and not have a rebellious streak in you and that that's that that did kind of drive my way of thinking a lot when I was growing up.
[572.32s - 580.32s] And not only did it drive my way of thinking I think I found that kind of music because that's the way I was sort of engineered in the first place so yeah.
[581.32s - 582.32s] Who are you listening to when you grow up.
[584.88s - 590.88s] Bad brains black flag agnostic front crow mags black Sabbath is my favorite band of all time.
[592.40s - 593.40s] Yeah those kind of bands.
[594.40s - 601.42s] A lot of your work is it's focused on encouraging people to take ownership and responsibility for things.
[601.42s - 619.71s] One of the things that I've been thinking about a lot recently is whether it's possible to take too much responsibility or too much ownership where you start to believe that you're at fault or you're accountable for things and blame yourself too frequently blame yourself too much.
[620.71s - 621.71s] You think that's possible.
[623.22s - 628.44s] There's a way that it can happen usually from a leadership perspective when people ask me this question.
[629.44s - 631.44s] Hey Kent is it possible to take too much ownership.
[631.44s - 632.44s] The answer is yes.
[632.44s - 644.44s] And that is if I'm in charge and you're working for me and I take so much ownership over a mission or over a project that you don't feel like you have any input at all.
[645.44s - 653.44s] Then I've taken too much ownership as far as as like as an individual person there's going to be things in your life that you don't have control over.
[654.80s - 672.15s] And you know one of the one of the early questions that I got asked about this you know like for instance someone gets a terrible disease and you know or their kids gets gets a terrible disease a random disease that's through no fault of anyone.
[673.15s - 681.15s] The kid gets sick or the person gets sick and no there's nothing you can do about that what you can take ownership those how you respond to that situation and so that's what you have to do.
[681.15s - 682.15s] There's things that you can control.
[683.15s - 684.15s] There's things you can't control.
[684.15s - 688.15s] Now I will tell you that human beings can control a lot more than they think they can.
[689.15s - 703.15s] And oftentimes it's pretty easy just to say oh that's not me that's not on me and I think that's that's the whole genesis of the idea of extreme ownership is most of the time or much of the time people say that's not my fault.
[703.15s - 710.15s] There's nothing I can do about that and more often than people think there is something you can do about it and you can and it is your fault.
[713.97s - 720.97s] I find it interesting to think about it's not your fault but it is your responsibility as well and how that sits in amongst this.
[722.71s - 733.71s] My concern with it is don't get me wrong I think that right now the vast majority of people need to take more responsibility I think that it is a great counter to a victim mindset I think that it helps people with agency and sovereignty.
[735.60s - 744.60s] I can see elements in my life though of times when I blame myself for things which I'm in no way even remotely associated with.
[745.60s - 757.60s] So for instance let's say that I'm doing a podcast with someone or I'm doing a live event right now I'm facilitating some discussion and I ask a question and the guest fluffs the response like gives a poor response.
[757.60s - 772.60s] A lot of the time the first place that I would go is that was on me somehow I should have asked a better question and even if I'd ask the absolute perfect question and you could roll that forward into a relationship you know that you're in a relationship with a bad partner or something occurs.
[773.60s - 784.44s] I just I'm trying to find that line of how people can balance it so that they don't end up putting so much pressure and weight on them that it crushes them.
[784.44s - 786.44s] Well here's two examples of what you're talking about.
[787.44s - 799.60s] You mentioned one relationship another one is just if you're working for me so if you're working for me and you don't show up on time or you're not professional when you're conducting your briefs.
[800.60s - 809.92s] I need to say something to you and I need to take ownership of the fact that I haven't made it clear that hey you need to show up on time and hey you need to be more professional and hey you need to wear the right uniform or dress the part.
[810.92s - 822.92s] I need to take ownership of that and maybe if I do and I talk to you and we discuss why it's important and you say I really didn't think about that and you change your ways and you get on board and you start showing up on time to start acting more professional it's great we solve the problem.
[823.92s - 833.92s] There's also a chance that you're late again or you show up you know with with booze on your breath or whatever and we're meeting with a client and I say hey Chris you can't do this this is look I'm serious.
[833.92s - 849.92s] You cannot act this way this reflects bad on all of us and maybe you and I might even say listen if you keep this up you're not even working here anymore I'm gonna have to get rid of you say I know I do I love working with you it's gonna be great I won't do it again and maybe that solves your problem or maybe you're late again or you continue to act on professionally and then I'm gonna get rid of you.
[850.92s - 853.92s] I'm gonna say hey Chris look I talked to you I tried to explain this to you.
[854.92s - 857.98s] And at a certain point this job isn't for you so that can happen.
[858.98s - 866.98s] And I have to take ownership of the fact that you are actually not capable of doing this job that I've asked you so that's fine same thing happened in relationship right.
[867.98s - 878.98s] Look if you're in relationship with someone and you're bickering about where we're gonna go for dinner or you came home late from work and all you do is well I've been working all day.
[879.98s - 884.98s] You should respect the fact that I've been working on it like that's that's actually on you that's actually on you and you can make adjustments to that.
[884.98s - 890.98s] Now can you get to a point in relationship where the other person is not a good fit for you.
[891.98s - 897.98s] And at some point you say you know what I've made these adjustments I've come home you know on time I've texted you when I was going to be late.
[898.98s - 903.98s] And these these other things are coming up and you say you know what I don't think this is working and I don't think this is a good relationship.
[904.98s - 911.98s] So at a certain point you say OK I've made the adjustments that I can make and I have to take ownership of the fact that we're not a good match.
[911.98s - 925.98s] So yeah there's there's plenty of times where taking ownership means actually solving the problem not continuing to to pour the problem down your neck every night because that's not very helpful to anybody.
[926.98s - 930.98s] So yes at a certain point you have to you have to make adjustments and you have to move forward.
[931.98s - 940.11s] There's a lot of similarities I think between your personal philosophy and Jordan Peterson's I know you've spoken to him a couple of times what have you learned from him.
[940.11s - 952.72s] Well the the most interesting thing that I learned from Jordan Peterson and I mentioned this the first time he came on my podcast was that you know he's a trained academic that studied this stuff his whole life.
[953.72s - 967.72s] And we came to a lot of the same conclusions about things and I just came to those conclusions through living and the experiences that I had and he came to them through studying this stuff in a very rigorous way.
[968.72s - 973.72s] And the cool thing is luckily for me I had written books that sort of predated.
[974.72s - 975.72s] I got there first.
[975.72s - 985.72s] Yeah it wasn't that I got there first but I mean these were the thoughts that I had I mean discipline equals freedom that book came out I think before I before Jordan Peterson was on the scene.
[986.72s - 991.72s] It's the book Extreme Ownership which is about taking personal responsibility what's about taking responsibility and you can definitely apply it to personal responsibility.
[992.72s - 1003.72s] So luckily for me those those books kind of predated Jordan Peterson coming on to the scene and and doing everything that he did but again it's not like I created any of those things.
[1004.72s - 1011.72s] It's not like I created it before he created and it's not like he created it before other philosophers had figured these things out.
[1011.72s - 1023.72s] So I'd say that the most interesting thing about Jordan Peterson that I found and I think it was pretty interesting to him too was the fact that we both had kind of come to these same conclusions and we had lived very different lives.
[1024.72s - 1040.81s] I mean I'm sure there's more disparate lives that we could live but they're pretty different lives and that's that was a very interesting thing and it made me feel like well it made me feel good about the fact that the things that I had figured out were in line with things that he had figured out.
[1041.81s - 1048.81s] And that means maybe there's a little bit more strength and universality to these things that I believed which which felt pretty good.
[1049.81s - 1052.81s] It's gonna pause that you wanna go and see if there's someone stealing things outside.
[1054.81s - 1057.39s] If there's someone stealing things can you let me know.
[1060.03s - 1062.99s] It looks like they're bringing things in that's the opposite.
[1066.64s - 1073.64s] It's nice to know or to think that something that's been proven in the field of battle or on the field of play is backed up in academia.
[1074.64s - 1079.64s] That someone can go through the annals of philosophy history and come to a similar conclusion as you.
[1080.64s - 1093.09s] Absolutely and the stuff that I say is in the Bible, the stuff that I say is in Stoicism and Jordan Peterson says the stuff that I say or I say the stuff that he says again.
[1094.09s - 1100.09s] I'm not trying to compete with Jordan Peterson on any level especially some kind of an intellectual level.
[1100.09s - 1109.09s] But we have similar thoughts about things and that predated either one of us knowing who each other were.
[1110.09s - 1111.09s] So I think that's pretty cool.
[1112.09s - 1115.09s] Why do you think people are drawn to advice that's telling them to do hard things?
[1116.35s - 1117.35s] Kind of seems counterintuitive.
[1121.52s - 1126.52s] Why do I think people are drawn to advice telling them to do hard things?
[1127.52s - 1134.52s] Because I think any person, any human realizes that if you want some kind of a good outcome you're going to have to work hard for it.
[1135.52s - 1141.52s] And if you don't work hard for something you're not going to get an outcome that's really worth much.
[1143.89s - 1148.89s] Well that is the thing that separates the achievements on the other side of it, right?
[1149.89s - 1150.89s] If it was easy everyone would do it.
[1151.89s - 1152.89s] If it was easy everyone would achieve it.
[1152.89s - 1158.05s] So this is one of the things that I try and rely on when training has been getting hard.
[1159.05s - 1160.05s] So I ruptured my Achilles a couple of years ago.
[1161.05s - 1163.05s] That sucked. I wouldn't advise it as an injury generally.
[1164.05s - 1165.05s] Yeah and it's like a random.
[1166.05s - 1169.05s] A lot of times people just do it, you know, get in out of their car or something.
[1170.05s - 1171.05s] I was playing cricket.
[1172.05s - 1173.05s] The most British way to snap an Achilles.
[1174.05s - 1175.05s] That's a very British way to snap your Achilles for sure.
[1176.05s - 1181.50s] During that, during the rehab for that it's pretty just uncomfortable.
[1182.50s - 1183.50s] It's endless calf raises, right, which is not fun.
[1184.50s - 1193.40s] And the discomfort that you feel and the fear of it re- rupturing, which is the number one thing you do on it to have happen.
[1194.40s - 1196.40s] The thing that I went back to in my mind was this is why I'm here.
[1197.40s - 1201.94s] The discomfort that I was feeling, the effort, the pain, the sweat.
[1201.94s - 1202.94s] Thankfully this was during COVID.
[1203.94s - 1206.94s] So it meant that if I had to do a workout every single morning for half an hour on just my calves,
[1207.94s - 1208.94s] it's like, what else are you doing, right? There's a pandemic going on.
[1209.94s - 1212.97s] This is why you're here was the reminder.
[1213.97s - 1219.97s] It's like, look, this is the reason why the re- rupture rate is five to 10% because people don't want to do this thing.
[1220.97s - 1226.97s] People don't want to do the thing because it hurts because it takes half an hour every single day for nearly 12 months.
[1227.97s - 1228.97s] It's a full 12 month recovery.
[1230.26s - 1231.26s] That's why this is why you're here.
[1232.26s - 1233.26s] And I think that you're right.
[1234.26s - 1243.45s] I think that the selection is people deep down know that picking up heavy things physically, psychologically, existentially, culturally is good for us.
[1244.45s - 1245.45s] And I think that that's why it's attractive.
[1247.19s - 1248.19s] I agree.
[1250.88s - 1256.08s] Another thing that I think is that it's one of the reasons why people can become a little bit triggered.
[1257.08s - 1260.08s] They can become a little bit uncomfortable when they see somebody else that's got a lot of discipline.
[1260.08s - 1267.08s] Because I think deep down they know that if they had that thing, that that would fix a lot of the problems that they have in their life.
[1268.08s - 1269.08s] Is this a dynamic that you've seen?
[1270.08s - 1278.08s] I'm sure that's a bummer for someone to look at someone else that's working really hard and achieving some positive things.
[1279.08s - 1285.08s] And they know that they're not maybe working as hard as they could be and they're not really achieving what they want to achieve.
[1286.08s - 1287.08s] I'm sure that stings a little bit.
[1287.08s - 1295.36s] Another thing that Jordan said recently is that the problem with Twitter is that the price of being a prick has fallen to zero.
[1296.36s - 1297.36s] I feel like you'd agree with that as well.
[1298.55s - 1300.55s] Yeah, I guess I'd agree with that.
[1301.55s - 1307.55s] If you're going to spend a bunch of time on Twitter, you're going to run into a bunch of people that don't like you.
[1308.74s - 1310.74s] And they're going to say it and there's nothing you can do about it.
[1311.74s - 1318.74s] And the ability for people's words and the consequences of those words to become detached as well is something that's only pretty recent.
[1319.74s - 1323.74s] I mean, I guess you could have sent a mean telegram a hundred years ago.
[1324.74s - 1335.15s] Yeah, I would recommend that you don't let random bots or people on Twitter bother you that much.
[1336.15s - 1337.15s] That's my recommendation.
[1338.15s - 1339.15s] I would recommend you.
[1340.15s - 1348.15s] You know, the first time I kind of experienced that it was when I was on, I was on Rogan for the first time and the YouTube video came out.
[1349.15s - 1355.76s] And I sat there with my oldest daughter who is probably maybe 14 or 15 at the time.
[1356.76s - 1360.76s] And I sat there and read these heinous comments about being laughed.
[1361.76s - 1364.76s] I mean, it was kind of, you know, some were pretty good.
[1365.76s - 1366.76s] It was kind of funny.
[1367.76s - 1375.76s] Yeah, I'm not getting bothered by somebody that wants to talk smack about me for whatever on Twitter.
[1376.76s - 1378.76s] And also there's probably some truth to whatever they're saying.
[1379.76s - 1380.76s] You know, they say I'm a big knuckle-dragger.
[1381.76s - 1382.76s] Yeah, probably right.
[1383.76s - 1384.76s] They say I'm an idiot.
[1385.76s - 1386.76s] Yeah, there's definitely some of that.
[1387.76s - 1388.76s] What else?
[1389.82s - 1390.82s] Do you swear much?
[1391.82s - 1392.82s] I don't think I've ever heard you swear.
[1393.82s - 1394.82s] I don't swear a ton.
[1394.82s - 1397.82s] And look, there's a term we have in America.
[1398.82s - 1402.82s] I don't know if you have this in England, but swear like a sailor, meaning people in the Navy swear a lot.
[1403.82s - 1412.82s] And certainly when I was in the SEAL teams, I probably swore every seventh, fifth to seventh word that came out of my mouth,
[1413.82s - 1415.82s] especially talking to a SEAL platoon about something.
[1416.82s - 1420.01s] But no, I don't swear a ton.
[1420.01s - 1426.01s] I mean, if you listen to my podcast all the time, you'll see that when there's an appropriate time to swear, then I will.
[1427.01s - 1430.01s] But even it's interesting, you know, if you swear all the time, it kind of loses its impact.
[1431.01s - 1436.01s] And so when I do swear on the podcast, people usually say, oh, this is an important thing.
[1437.01s - 1445.01s] This is obviously very, very powerful emotion that he's feeling right because he just said a swear word.
[1445.01s - 1447.01s] So yeah, but I don't swear a ton.
[1448.01s - 1450.01s] And even when I was in the SEAL teams, I'd come home at night and wouldn't swear.
[1451.01s - 1453.01s] I don't swear in front of my wife and I wouldn't swear in front of my kids.
[1454.01s - 1455.01s] So I would just turn it off.
[1456.01s - 1457.01s] And that's that.
[1458.01s - 1460.01s] It's like when you hear Sam Harris swear, if you ever hear him do this.
[1461.01s - 1462.01s] It's sprinkled very infrequently.
[1463.01s - 1465.01s] But when it happens, you're okay.
[1466.46s - 1467.46s] Yeah, it's an attention-getter.
[1468.46s - 1470.46s] I have a friend, Daniel Sloss, a comedian and Scottish.
[1471.46s - 1473.46s] So that combined is like a multiplying force.
[1473.46s - 1477.46s] And I actually think that he probably uses more swear words than actual words.
[1478.46s - 1479.46s] They're just that Salt Bay guy.
[1480.46s - 1482.46s] It's kind of like that, but just throughout every single sentence.
[1483.46s - 1484.46s] Deep programming, I think is important.
[1485.46s - 1486.46s] It's something that I've really tried to work on.
[1487.46s - 1494.46s] You know, just being a working-class lad from the UK is part and parcel of the language perhaps is being in the SEALs.
[1495.46s - 1500.46s] Listening back and especially hearing yourself speak a lot, which you've done over the last six, seven years or whatever.
[1500.46s - 1501.46s] I don't know.
[1502.46s - 1506.46s] There's something about it that I just, I would rather save it for the times when I need it.
[1507.46s - 1509.10s] Yeah.
[1510.10s - 1519.12s] And there is, if you're doing something like where people are going to listen to it sort of detached from the moment that you're living in,
[1520.12s - 1521.12s] then it's different as well.
[1522.12s - 1524.12s] So it doesn't have the, it doesn't come across the same.
[1525.12s - 1530.12s] And you and I having a conversation over lunch, talking about whatever, that's different.
[1530.12s - 1535.12s] And you know, those, those words are a little bit more fitting in those situations, but
[1536.12s - 1537.12s] Or if you're watching the UFC.
[1538.12s - 1540.12s] Yeah. If you're watching the UFC, but yeah.
[1541.12s - 1546.12s] Look, I don't really, if people swear, it's not, it's not like a huge concern of mine.
[1547.12s - 1553.44s] I don't really care that much, but maybe you could improve your vocabulary a little bit and use it.
[1554.44s - 1555.44s] To not always rely on the same five swear words.
[1556.44s - 1557.44s] Yeah.
[1557.44s - 1560.44s] But some people use them well and they're hilarious when they use them.
[1561.44s - 1562.44s] Daniel uses his spectacularly.
[1563.44s - 1565.44s] I would say he's probably got a black belt in, in swearing.
[1566.44s - 1567.44s] Right on.
[1568.76s - 1574.08s] I want to revisit your good video for the people that haven't seen it.
[1575.08s - 1583.18s] It's a two minute long edit that was released seven years ago on your YouTube channel and it's got like nearly 10 million plays or something now.
[1584.18s - 1596.34s] And in it, you're encouraging people to respond to setbacks and things that don't go well by saying good by leaning into the discomfort by seeing it as an opportunity.
[1597.34s - 1605.34s] Was there anything you think that people misinterpreted about that video or about good generally as a concept?
[1606.34s - 1612.34s] Look, look, if you take any idea and you take it to an extreme, then that idea is going to become bad.
[1613.34s - 1614.34s] That's the idea of extreme ownership.
[1615.34s - 1629.34s] If you take it to an extreme where you're, as you pointed out earlier, you're blaming yourself because your daughter got a disease or you're blaming yourself because your husband is abusing you.
[1630.34s - 1632.34s] Like there's a point where you think anything go too far.
[1633.34s - 1637.34s] And well, you know, I mean, there's, there's some pretty good memes about that on the internet.
[1638.34s - 1639.34s] Yeah, there's some good memes about that on the internet.
[1640.34s - 1641.34s] Oh, crashed my car.
[1641.34s - 1642.34s] My dog died good.
[1643.34s - 1644.34s] I needed a new car anyway.
[1645.34s - 1646.34s] So yeah, take it to an extreme.
[1647.34s - 1650.34s] It can be, it can become pretty silly or funny depending on how you take it.
[1651.34s - 1653.34s] But for the most part, you're going to run into challenges in life.
[1654.34s - 1659.63s] And if you curl up into a ball and complain about it, that's not going to help you.
[1660.63s - 1661.63s] And if you say, okay, cool, good.
[1662.63s - 1663.63s] Here's some adjustments I can make to move forward.
[1664.63s - 1667.63s] That's going to be a better move than, than cowering.
[1669.43s - 1670.43s] Is there anything that you wish that you'd added in?
[1671.43s - 1676.33s] I don't know.
[1677.33s - 1680.33s] I mean, I said it during one of my podcasts and my friend Echo turned it into a video.
[1681.33s - 1682.33s] So, so that's it.
[1683.33s - 1685.33s] If I wanted to, I probably would have expanded on it or done something else.
[1686.33s - 1687.33s] I don't know.
[1688.68s - 1689.68s] Do you tell me, did I miss something?
[1690.68s - 1691.68s] I don't think so.
[1692.68s - 1698.68s] I mean, it's pithy and obviously one of, as you've said, it's extensive, not exhaustive as a solution.
[1699.68s - 1707.68s] And this is, this is Twitter and a nutshell that you have to sacrifice how explicit you're being for brevity, right?
[1708.68s - 1715.68s] For it being sufficiently succinct that people can understand it and you can get it in, in a one minute 55 so that people can actually watch it and won't click off or whatever.
[1716.68s - 1727.80s] And people will then use the lack of detail to expand that out and say, yeah, dog died in the car crash and good.
[1728.80s - 1730.80s] Right. You can see how that's easy to criticize.
[1731.80s - 1733.80s] But I think overall this is really great story actually.
[1734.80s - 1736.80s] It was about Zeno of Citium, the guy that founded Stoicism.
[1737.80s - 1748.80s] And often he was criticized that he was very abrupt when he would speak to people, when he was giving his, because he was around in a time of the Sophists, right?
[1749.80s - 1756.80s] And Sophistry was all about these big, long, extravagant philosophical treaties and they would use these super, super long words and stuff.
[1756.80s - 1762.80s] And what he found was that people didn't like the fact of how abrupt he was, didn't like that.
[1763.90s - 1768.00s] And someone once criticized him for it and he said, yes, I am. Thank you.
[1769.00s - 1771.00s] If I could, I would even shorten the syllables as well.
[1772.00s - 1776.00s] And I like the idea of someone that uses brevity in an effective way.
[1777.00s - 1785.00s] And this sort of links in with something that I've been thinking about recently, which is to do with the outcomes that we get in life.
[1785.00s - 1798.50s] So all of the concerns that we have, all of the sleepless nights and the neuroses and the overthinking and the confusion and the uncertainty and the self-doubt and all of that stuff, all combined together.
[1799.50s - 1804.50s] I think probably net us about maybe five or 10% better outcomes in life.
[1805.50s - 1815.76s] It's my belief that most of the qualities that you have, your integrity, your virtue, your discipline, your hard work, your growth-mindedness, your humor, your resilience, all of that are forces that are very, very difficult for you.
[1816.76s - 1820.76s] To slow down and that once they've got started, it's incredibly hard for you to stop them.
[1821.76s - 1828.82s] And what you're doing with all of the extra concern that comes over the top of that is just making your day-to-day experience of it a lot more miserable.
[1829.82s - 1837.20s] And I've been thinking a lot about how can you, how can you, I'm more fatty, right?
[1838.20s - 1841.20s] The love of fate, the love of the destiny that I have is the one that's going to come.
[1841.20s - 1842.20s] I understand that I have control over it.
[1842.20s - 1846.20s] I understand that I have agency, that I have sovereignty, that I can impact my destiny.
[1846.20s - 1851.84s] But also that all of the work and the effort that I put in previously is going to carry me through.
[1852.84s - 1863.39s] And if I've been successful so far that worrying about success going forward, whether or not it's going to occur, it doesn't seem super smart.
[1864.39s - 1873.39s] And then relating that to good is that not only do you need to, or can you accept something and say that it is good, you can also have the sense of resiliency,
[1874.39s - 1877.39s] that you know that you've got through something that's worse than this before.
[1877.39s - 1878.39s] How did you get on last time?
[1879.52s - 1880.52s] Did you face something that was difficult?
[1882.16s - 1883.16s] You're still here.
[1883.16s - 1885.16s] By virtue of the fact that you're listening to this, you're still here.
[1887.37s - 1893.50s] And there's a part of that that makes me think about good is an active philosophy, right?
[1893.50s - 1895.50s] It's actively saying something happens.
[1896.50s - 1897.50s] I'm going to lean into it.
[1897.50s - 1901.50s] I'm going to be forward motion, right?
[1901.50s - 1908.36s] And then the backup that you seem to have behind that as well is look at all of the things that I've dealt with before.
[1909.75s - 1911.75s] Look at all of the effectiveness that I've come through with previously.
[1912.75s - 1915.91s] I think that those two combined together are pretty powerful.
[1917.42s - 1918.42s] I agree.
[1918.42s - 1926.63s] Speaking about motivation and stuff as well, which is obviously kind of the other side of what you do.
[1927.63s - 1928.63s] You know why I'm laughing, right?
[1928.63s - 1929.63s] Why?
[1929.63s - 1933.63s] Because you are telling the story about this guy who gave really brief answers.
[1933.63s - 1937.63s] And then you talked for six minutes and I said, I agree.
[1937.63s - 1938.63s] So just having fun.
[1939.63s - 1940.63s] Good man.
[1943.52s - 1944.52s] You and Zeno have got a lot in common.
[1944.52s - 1945.52s] Yeah, maybe.
[1946.52s - 1948.87s] Do you think that people overcomplicate motivation?
[1949.87s - 1951.12s] Yes.
[1955.26s - 1960.25s] I find that discussions about motivation a lot of the time.
[1960.25s - 1966.25s] I mean, you are the soundtrack to a lot of motivation, compilation, video.
[1967.25s - 1968.25s] That's right, yeah.
[1969.25s - 1972.25s] Motivation universe 40 minute get up and get after it.
[1973.25s - 1974.25s] Jocko video.
[1976.25s - 1985.57s] So I think that a lot of the discussions about motivation can cause people to believe that there's some magical state that they need to be in before they do something.
[1986.57s - 1987.57s] Yeah.
[1987.57s - 1993.57s] And as I've said since day one, it's motivation is a feeling that comes and goes and it doesn't matter whether it's there or not.
[1993.57s - 1996.57s] Discipline is infinitely more important.
[1996.57s - 1999.67s] So no matter how you feel, get up and do what you're supposed to do.
[2000.67s - 2001.67s] That's it.
[2001.67s - 2002.67s] And that's discipline.
[2002.67s - 2003.67s] That's not motivation.
[2003.67s - 2008.67s] If you only did what you were supposed to do when you were motivated to do it, that's leaving it to chance.
[2008.67s - 2011.67s] But if you're disciplined, you go do what you're supposed to do.
[2011.67s - 2012.67s] That's the way it works.
[2012.67s - 2016.82s] I went and listened to an episode you did with Sam Harris.
[2016.82s - 2018.82s] Seven years ago now, a long time ago.
[2020.88s - 2025.88s] He came up with this really interesting idea where he said that you can't fake courage.
[2028.71s - 2031.71s] That's one of the most interesting ways to look at it.
[2031.71s - 2035.93s] He said that courage or bravery, I think is actually what he was talking about.
[2036.93s - 2037.93s] It's an emotion that you can't fake.
[2037.93s - 2041.93s] If you fake bravery when you're terrified, that is bravery.
[2043.09s - 2046.09s] And I kind of feel like motivation is the same thing.
[2046.09s - 2050.09s] If you do the thing when you're feeling unmotivated, that is motivation.
[2050.09s - 2051.09s] That's it.
[2051.09s - 2055.09s] So are you saying that all of the Jocko videos of motivation, they can just go off of YouTube?
[2055.09s - 2057.09s] Well, I say in a lot of those videos.
[2057.09s - 2063.09s] And sometimes that's what it takes for people to get motivated is to realize that that motivation doesn't matter.
[2063.09s - 2064.09s] It doesn't matter.
[2064.09s - 2065.09s] It's a self-defeating video.
[2065.09s - 2067.09s] Just shut up and go do what you're supposed to do.
[2069.09s - 2070.09s] Yeah.
[2070.09s - 2075.09s] I mean, the difference between the person that spends all day wondering about whether they should go to the gym or not.
[2076.09s - 2078.09s] And the person that just goes to the gym or not.
[2078.09s - 2080.09s] Even if they both go, they net out at zero.
[2080.09s - 2084.09s] Apart from the fact that one person has spent the entire day obsessing over it.
[2084.09s - 2085.09s] Yeah.
[2085.09s - 2087.09s] And probably wasting some brain power on it.
[2087.09s - 2091.09s] Does this thing called the, I bro science called the anxiety cost.
[2091.09s - 2093.09s] So, you know, opportunity cost, right?
[2093.09s - 2095.09s] That you, because of doing one thing, you can't do another thing.
[2095.09s - 2104.09s] Anxiety cost to me is the wasted mental effort that you go through obsessing over something when you could fix it quite easily by just doing it.
[2104.09s - 2109.09s] It's one of the most compelling reasons for doing a morning training workout for me.
[2109.09s - 2114.09s] If you've got to train every day, every morning when you wake up, your daily to-do list resets, right?
[2114.09s - 2120.09s] You get out of bed and then your to-do list of meditate and walk the dog and answer emails and do all that.
[2120.09s - 2125.32s] The sooner that you confront load that stuff, the rest of the day is just, ah.
[2125.32s - 2127.21s] Yeah.
[2127.21s - 2129.34s] Discipline equals freedom.
[2129.34s - 2131.53s] That's it.
[2131.53s - 2134.53s] I mean, if you have the discipline to get up and get the things done.
[2134.53s - 2138.53s] Well, I've usually, I often tell a similar story.
[2138.53s - 2145.53s] This is the same thing that you just said, which is, you know, the weekend where you really only had two things to do for the weekend, whatever it was.
[2145.53s - 2149.53s] You had to write this thing and you had to answer this other thing.
[2149.53s - 2153.53s] And on Friday, you're like, I'll do it tomorrow and on Saturday, like I'll do it.
[2153.53s - 2155.53s] And it's basically hanging over your head the whole weekend.
[2155.53s - 2160.53s] Whereas if you'd just done Friday afternoon, the whole weekend would have been a lot better.
[2160.53s - 2161.53s] So just do the thing.
[2161.53s - 2162.53s] I agree with you.
[2162.53s - 2163.53s] Just do the thing.
[2163.53s - 2164.53s] Just do the thing.
[2164.53s - 2165.53s] Just do the thing, man.
[2165.53s - 2166.53s] What does courage mean to you?
[2166.53s - 2168.53s] Is that a good definition from Sam?
[2168.53s - 2171.53s] Do you think doing the thing in spite of the way that you feel?
[2171.53s - 2172.60s] Yeah.
[2172.60s - 2174.60s] I think that's solid.
[2174.60s - 2176.60s] Somebody asked me a question the other day.
[2176.60s - 2178.60s] Does courage have to involve risk?
[2178.60s - 2180.60s] And I thought about it a little bit.
[2180.60s - 2181.60s] I haven't thought.
[2181.60s - 2186.63s] I don't sit around and think about a lot of stuff, which might be obvious, I guess.
[2186.63s - 2187.63s] Yeah.
[2187.63s - 2201.79s] I think if you're going to get credit for courage, then there has to be some level of risk, whether it's, you know, capital risk in doing something in a business or physical risk if you're doing something to run into a fire to save somebody.
[2201.79s - 2202.79s] Yeah.
[2202.79s - 2205.79s] So I think courage has to have some kind of risk involved.
[2205.79s - 2214.92s] And then, yes, I agree with Sam Harris when he pointed out that if you're acting, if you're doing the thing, then that's courage.
[2214.92s - 2218.08s] No matter how you feel inside your little brain.
[2218.08s - 2222.08s] Are you sure that you don't spend that much time sat around thinking of stuff?
[2222.08s - 2226.08s] Because I know that you do a ton of prep for each of your podcast episodes.
[2226.08s - 2235.08s] And as you're reading through a book, I mean, the insights that you pull out of that that you drag across between you, I think you might be doing yourself a bit of a disservice there.
[2235.08s - 2246.17s] Well, yes, when I'm reading a book, I'm certainly applying the context of my life and my experiences and what I know and what I think I know to that.
[2246.17s - 2249.17s] So I guess, but that's different than sitting around and thinking.
[2249.17s - 2252.17s] Oh, you mean like the sort of the chin stroking?
[2252.17s - 2253.17s] Yeah.
[2253.17s - 2254.17s] I don't do a lot of that.
[2254.17s - 2255.17s] Maybe I should do more.
[2255.17s - 2256.17s] I probably need to.
[2256.17s - 2257.17s] I'd be interested to see that.
[2257.17s - 2260.17s] I could see you sat in a smoking jacket somewhere.
[2260.17s - 2262.17s] Cigar.
[2263.17s - 2264.17s] Yeah.
[2264.17s - 2274.30s] I mean, you know, I think when I run, I think when I'm doing jiu-jitsu, I think when I'm surfing and those are just, that's a great kind of empty mind.
[2274.30s - 2278.30s] And there's times where I'm running and I have to stop and write something down.
[2278.30s - 2282.30s] You know, I'll pull out my, I'll be listening to some music or something.
[2282.30s - 2288.84s] I'll stop and take a note in my iPhone about something that I just thought of.
[2288.84s - 2291.13s] So it happens.
[2291.13s - 2295.13s] Courage is very hard to find when life gets comfortable for people.
[2295.13s - 2304.32s] How can they stop their bravery from eroding when times are easy?
[2304.32s - 2308.36s] I guess, I guess what we already talked about.
[2308.36s - 2310.77s] Do something that's hard and do it every day.
[2310.77s - 2312.77s] That's what it's one of the nice things about jiu-jitsu.
[2312.77s - 2313.77s] You're going to get choked.
[2313.77s - 2314.77s] You're going to be uncomfortable.
[2314.77s - 2315.77s] You're going to get smashed.
[2315.77s - 2316.77s] You're going to have to tap out.
[2316.77s - 2319.77s] Your ego is going to get abused.
[2319.77s - 2323.06s] Your go do that.
[2323.06s - 2324.06s] Go do that.
[2324.06s - 2328.06s] You go for a run, lift, just do hard stuff.
[2328.06s - 2332.06s] And that's a good way to keep that, I guess, fresh.
[2332.06s - 2336.06s] You think that maps across onto other areas of life as well?
[2336.06s - 2340.18s] It certainly seems like it does.
[2340.18s - 2343.18s] But there's no guarantee on any of this stuff.
[2343.18s - 2344.18s] Really.
[2344.18s - 2345.18s] There's no guarantee.
[2345.18s - 2348.18s] And it depends on what kind of courage you're talking about.
[2348.18s - 2353.63s] Are we talking about courage where you're going to die or you could possibly die?
[2353.63s - 2355.63s] Or is that what we're calling courage?
[2355.63s - 2359.63s] Because there's people that have come from every walk of life that have stepped up in
[2359.63s - 2360.63s] that situation.
[2360.63s - 2363.63s] And there's people that have come from every walk of life and have failed in that situation.
[2363.63s - 2369.01s] So if you're talking life or death, I mean, I think you actually have to get to someone
[2369.01s - 2372.01s] that is sort of good with dying and they're okay with it.
[2372.01s - 2378.20s] And then they're going to have a lot easier time pushing into that fold if it shows up.
[2378.20s - 2381.43s] Have you seen those Detroit self-defense videos?
[2381.43s - 2384.43s] Yeah, I think, I know I have.
[2384.43s - 2385.43s] I'm trying to think how I saw them.
[2385.43s - 2388.43s] But yeah, because a lot of jujitsu people will repost those things.
[2388.43s - 2389.43s] Yeah.
[2389.43s - 2395.43s] What do you think that people misunderstand when it comes to life and death fights, street
[2395.43s - 2396.43s] fights?
[2396.43s - 2402.43s] What do you think most normal people who haven't been in one misbelieve?
[2402.43s - 2407.45s] I don't know what that has to do with those Detroit videos.
[2407.45s - 2410.45s] Those Detroit videos are definitely...
[2410.45s - 2411.84s] It's a pantomime.
[2411.84s - 2412.84s] Yeah.
[2412.84s - 2423.64s] So I guess to answer your question, what do most people not understand about a street fight?
[2423.64s - 2428.64s] They're probably not used to just the level of violence that's going to occur.
[2428.64s - 2433.86s] Maybe this is what you're getting at with the Detroit self-defense videos or whatever
[2433.86s - 2434.86s] they are.
[2434.86s - 2441.86s] The choreographed maneuvers that work when you and I are going through them and sort of
[2441.86s - 2445.86s] focusing, those aren't going to work in real life.
[2445.86s - 2448.86s] So if you think that you're going to be able to drop someone with one punch or you think
[2448.86s - 2449.86s] anybody...
[2449.86s - 2458.54s] All those things that are sort of the old traditional martial arts doing kata and I do this to you
[2458.54s - 2461.26s] and it causes this reaction, then my next move is over here.
[2461.26s - 2466.43s] Yeah, that stuff doesn't really work in a street fight.
[2466.43s - 2467.43s] Yeah.
[2467.43s - 2472.76s] The groin kick and the palm of the hand to the nose to run away from the...
[2472.76s - 2475.16s] As a female to run away from the attacker and stuff like that.
[2475.16s - 2476.16s] Yep.
[2476.16s - 2481.88s] It's not going to work well and it's not very reliable.
[2481.88s - 2484.83s] If you want to learn how to fight, you've got to learn how to fight.
[2484.83s - 2488.43s] You've got to do jiu-jitsu, moitai, wrestling, boxing.
[2488.43s - 2490.51s] That's what you need to do if you want to learn how to fight.
[2490.51s - 2495.02s] Have you been to go and see what Tim Kennedy is doing or put at his place with his self-defense
[2495.02s - 2496.02s] courses?
[2496.02s - 2498.94s] I have not been to one of his courses.
[2498.94s - 2505.30s] It's called Sheepdog Response but I've seen what he's doing and of course, Tim's not
[2505.30s - 2511.22s] only is he well-versed in martial arts clearly, he's also well-versed in weapons and he's
[2511.22s - 2517.74s] also well-versed in violence and so I know what he's teaching is legit stuff.
[2517.74s - 2523.50s] I'm pretty sure they're using live handheld tasers as well during that to just show people
[2523.50s - 2528.46s] precisely how difficult it is to whatever do the face palm and the eye gouge and the
[2528.46s - 2535.52s] fish hook and run away and I think he runs, I think it must be monthly, he does a special
[2535.52s - 2545.52s] one for, not military personnel, for the police and even them, the amount of training I think,
[2545.52s - 2549.69s] I mean we've seen this recently, right, that the training seems to be insufficient.
[2549.69s - 2554.41s] Yeah, the training for police officers is totally insufficient and it's horrible because
[2554.41s - 2557.69s] it's a very difficult job that you should be training.
[2557.93s - 2562.81s] I've been saying for the last several years that police officers should train 20% of the time,
[2563.82s - 2568.70s] 20% of the time that they work they should be training and right now it's not even,
[2568.70s - 2573.34s] it's probably not even a measurable percentage of time that they're working, I mean it's probably
[2573.34s - 2578.14s] in the fractions of a percent that they're training, they get horrible training and they're in
[2578.14s - 2585.16s] really dynamic situations and in doing an incredibly hard job. You don't know how to do that stuff,
[2585.64s - 2589.00s] you talked about the misconceptions of the street fighters, the person that thinks well you know
[2589.00s - 2592.84s] when I, if someone messes with me I'm just going to get wild and they think that's going to work
[2592.84s - 2598.36s] and that's not going to work especially against someone that's trained. So if you think that you're
[2598.36s - 2602.84s] going to have some magical powers because you're angry or because your adrenaline's going that's
[2602.84s - 2607.24s] not true and it's going to cost you in a big way. Especially if you come up against somebody
[2607.24s - 2612.68s] like Tim Kennedy who's genuinely trained. Oh for sure, yeah and you know this day and age,
[2613.32s - 2619.28s] well I mean I live in San Diego, California, a lot of people train, a lot of people train.
[2619.28s - 2623.28s] I wouldn't say it's the majority of people train but there are a lot, if you're going to fight in
[2623.28s - 2628.32s] San Diego there's a decent chance you're fighting against someone that knows how to fight and look
[2628.32s - 2635.68s] there's Jiu Jitsu on every street in San Diego, Jiu Jitsu academies. So yeah if you just think
[2635.68s - 2640.88s] you're going to be a tough guy it's going to be rough, it's going to be a rough tour.
[2640.88s - 2644.56s] I saw a video the other day that you may have seen as well of Tim talking about changes he
[2644.56s - 2651.36s] was making to his everyday carry. You see this? I don't think so. It was changing the weapon that
[2651.36s - 2657.60s] he was using, the pistol because recently some of the active shooters have been using body armor
[2657.60s - 2665.47s] so he's now gone to a relatively small caliber but an armor-peacing round. Are you concerned about
[2665.47s - 2670.03s] this increasing sophistication that seems to be coming from people that are shooters?
[2672.96s - 2681.77s] Yeah there's a little there's an escalation there right but that's uh the the military went through
[2681.77s - 2687.21s] this with the people we were fighting. They start wearing body armor, cool. Roger that,
[2687.21s - 2694.19s] you want to wear body armor? We'll get armor-peacing rounds. It's just a natural escalation of
[2694.19s - 2700.17s] things unfortunately but it's the way it is. It's kind of like the predator-prey dynamic right
[2700.17s - 2706.49s] of evolution. Yeah yeah the enemy's going to make adjustments and we're going to have to adjust back.
[2707.48s - 2711.40s] What are your principles for an everyday, are you allowed, can you have an everyday carry in
[2711.40s - 2716.20s] in uh San Diego? Yes. Right what are your principles that you follow for for that?
[2716.92s - 2725.52s] The the same as a normal person that wants to protect themselves. Well we had this
[2725.52s - 2730.64s] recent Fourth of July shooting right and then before that we had Uvalde and then before that we
[2730.64s - 2737.31s] had Buffalo. Have you got any idea if this is the sort of thing that can be stopped or can be
[2737.31s - 2745.45s] restricted in some way? Yeah I did I did some podcasts on these things and some of the the
[2745.45s - 2751.13s] biggest or I would say one of the most startling things and about as you watch the evolution of
[2751.29s - 2764.52s] this so in in 1955 in America there was 340 inpatient beds for people with mental health
[2764.52s - 2769.80s] issues per hundred thousand people so for every hundred thousand people in America
[2769.80s - 2776.65s] there was 340 inpatient beds for those people from people with mental health problems.
[2777.61s - 2790.70s] In 2007 it was 17 beds per hundred thousand so there the mental health capacity for treatment
[2790.70s - 2799.04s] in America is gone down in a what a 95% and the and there are some legitimate reasons why this
[2799.04s - 2802.08s] happened and a lot of it had to do with the fact that people were getting put in these
[2802.08s - 2807.12s] institutions and they there were some horrible abuses that were going on in some of these mental
[2807.12s - 2811.36s] institutions people being committed that didn't want to be in there people that were abused once
[2811.36s - 2815.60s] they were in there people that could never get out of there and there was a a backlash against
[2815.60s - 2822.00s] that and it all of a sudden became in the 70s hey this this mental health these mental health
[2822.00s - 2827.04s] facilities are evil they're bad there's abuse going on we need to shut them down and they shut
[2827.04s - 2833.92s] down a lot of them and so in doing that it certainly appears to me that they threw the
[2833.92s - 2840.48s] baby out with the bathwater and now we've got I mean you think San Diego there's two or three
[2840.48s - 2849.13s] million people here there's a lot of people that need help that need help mental health help and
[2849.13s - 2854.25s] there's just not a great place to get it I don't know I talk to police officers a lot police officers
[2854.25s - 2858.57s] come upon people all the time that they don't need to get put in jail they need to get put in
[2858.57s - 2863.61s] some kind of a mental health facility but they don't exist and so they go into jail for a little
[2863.61s - 2870.65s] while they they come back out and it's a problem so so if you take just the numbers of the beds
[2870.65s - 2876.36s] right what has that done to all the other aspects of mental health like all what about the outpatient
[2876.36s - 2881.64s] people how many doctors used to be ready to help somebody that was feeling depressed or was feeling
[2881.64s - 2886.36s] angry there probably were a lot more doctors back then that had the capability of treating those
[2886.36s - 2892.00s] things so we've we've really shut down our capacity to help people from a mental health
[2892.00s - 2898.54s] perspective and then on top of that we've added all these things into society that create more
[2898.54s - 2906.22s] mental health problems i.e drugs alcohol social media the fact that someone can stay in their
[2906.22s - 2909.50s] house all the time but then we put covid on people where they had to stay in their house
[2909.50s - 2913.02s] all the time they're getting stuck in echo chambers there's all these things that add to
[2913.02s - 2917.98s] mental health problems and we've we've really done away with a lot of the treatment that we had before
[2918.62s - 2925.50s] so hopefully in in the coming months and years we can start to get back to a place
[2926.06s - 2934.09s] where we start to build up our capacity for treating help people that have mental health issues
[2934.09s - 2940.60s] because these these shooters in these scenarios they clearly are they have mental health problems
[2940.60s - 2945.88s] well it's a trend as well that's dominated by young men it seems and that that seems especially
[2945.88s - 2950.92s] sad because these are men that could be out working a job or starting a business or being in
[2950.92s - 2956.72s] the armed forces or contributing to something and instead they're off on a rampage somewhere
[2956.72s - 2960.94s] it's horrible to see one of the differences we were talking before we started about the
[2960.94s - 2966.94s] differences between the us and the uk i've spent a lot of time late nights in city centers working
[2966.94s - 2972.60s] nightclubs and i've spent a lot of time around homeless people at two in the morning the only
[2972.60s - 2978.12s] people that are out at club promoters and and homeless people and party goers and uh the difference
[2978.76s - 2986.12s] between homeless people in the uk and homeless people in the us is more stark than the difference
[2986.12s - 2999.32s] between the cultures by a distance they are significantly more anti uh uh evidently um
[2999.32s - 3007.77s] in discomfort and and talking to themselves shuffling along uh rocking backward and forward
[3008.57s - 3012.57s] much more forthcoming significantly more forthcoming significantly more aggressive even
[3012.57s - 3018.73s] though i've never had anything super bad happen uh downtown san diego downtown denver downtown
[3018.73s - 3025.29s] austin i haven't spent a ton of time in america but i mean there are a lot of them and the safety
[3025.29s - 3033.28s] net that we have in the uk to sweep up people who fall through the cracks like that is it seems to
[3033.28s - 3039.05s] work right you know someone someone ends up in a really bad way mentally away you go will pop
[3039.05s - 3043.21s] you into awards you'll be looked after we'll be given the medication that you need there's no
[3043.21s - 3049.05s] insurance that restricts that but as you said earlier on it's like a vicious cycle of the people
[3049.05s - 3053.13s] who are the ones that are the most vulnerable are the ones that maybe get sent to jail perhaps
[3053.13s - 3056.65s] to get hooked on drugs the drugs make their mental health conditions worse which means that they can
[3057.37s - 3061.05s] they've further ingrained themselves into a life of either crime or homelessness which
[3061.05s - 3065.93s] takes them further away from a job in a balanced life and yeah i mean it kind of doesn't surprise
[3065.93s - 3071.29s] me but it's it's pretty sad to see yeah i'd be interested to know the numbers of of inpatient
[3071.29s - 3076.49s] beds per hundred thousand in the uk because if you think about the homeless people that you've seen
[3076.49s - 3081.52s] in san diego and there's two million people here right there's a lot of those people that probably
[3081.52s - 3084.80s] would be swept up and put into a place where they're getting the right mental health treatment
[3084.80s - 3089.68s] that they need and mental health treatment is not an easy thing to do it can take an extended
[3089.68s - 3095.04s] period of time to get someone sorted to a point where they're able to go out and contribute to
[3095.04s - 3100.08s] society so yeah i'd be interested to know those numbers and even from what you're saying right
[3100.08s - 3105.76s] now my guess is england's probably doing a better job of getting people the help that they need
[3106.32s - 3115.84s] how long have you been married now i think 25 years and you met your wife in bar rain right
[3115.84s - 3121.20s] yep you remember the story about the first thing that you said to her yes would you tell that uh
[3121.20s - 3131.07s] yeah so i was on a on a deployment in the navy i was on a ship while we were on a ship this is
[3131.07s - 3137.23s] back before internet on ships and we to occupy our time when you're a seal on a ship there's
[3137.23s - 3141.79s] nothing to do you don't have a job so you just sleep eat and lift is our joke and you can only
[3141.79s - 3149.15s] sleep eat and lift so long and then we we had a certain selection of movies on videotapes and so
[3149.15s - 3154.27s] one of the movies that we had was ace venture a pet detective with jim carrey and so we did a lot of
[3154.27s - 3162.27s] imitating ace venture a pet detective and when i so we eventually went to bar rain my the other
[3162.27s - 3165.87s] squad there's two squads in the seal platoon the other squad had actually gone to bar rain before
[3165.87s - 3170.51s] us squad two went to bar rain for a few days they were ahead of us and we didn't know anything about
[3170.51s - 3174.19s] bar rain we didn't know what was going on there because there's again there's no internet you
[3174.19s - 3179.08s] just know some we're going to some random place in the desert and squad one had work to do so we
[3179.08s - 3184.84s] stayed on the boat for a couple extra days and then when we finally flew to bar rain squad two
[3184.84s - 3190.11s] was waiting for us and they were they were saying hey this place is like there's good times to be
[3190.11s - 3196.67s] had there's bars and girls and the whole nine yards and so they had like they were staged and ready
[3196.67s - 3204.67s] to take us out and yeah we went to a bar and i and i with a big giant packed kind of club slash bar
[3204.67s - 3214.17s] and and i saw a tall beautiful blonde woman and actually actually one of my friends in squad two
[3215.32s - 3220.60s] had said to me oh there's these two girls you're going to be he's like i know you're going to talk
[3220.60s - 3225.32s] to him and he was kind of a shyer guy and i said i'm sure i'm sure they'll work out with you man
[3225.32s - 3232.52s] you're you'll do fine and sure enough walked in this bar saw my saw my future wife and i just
[3232.92s - 3239.23s] i walked up to her and i said in like a gym carry tone i said uh should i just call you
[3239.23s - 3245.15s] aphrodite goddess of love and she looked at me like i was an idiot which was accurate and then
[3245.15s - 3251.23s] you know i bought her a drink and the rest as they say is history how did you save that i want to
[3251.23s - 3258.09s] know how you turned that opening line around you know it was i did in a ridiculous enough way that
[3258.09s - 3264.73s] she could probably tell i wasn't taking myself too seriously i mean it it wasn't serious right
[3265.29s - 3271.69s] so if you're not being serious she laughed and we were good i didn't i didn't say it i didn't say
[3271.69s - 3277.05s] should i just call you aphrodite goddess of love no if i would have said that i probably
[3277.05s - 3281.21s] wouldn't have ended up with her yeah i was having fun what have you learned since being married to
[3281.21s - 3291.85s] a brit is there anything that you think has been a unique insight you know britain england the uk
[3291.85s - 3297.61s] long allies with america even though i guess originally it didn't start off that way clearly
[3297.61s - 3302.33s] look the fourth of july was a very difficult day for me yeah it was a very difficult day happy
[3302.33s - 3310.49s] trees and day to all of the ungrateful colonials uh no i i i love the historical aspects of england
[3311.45s - 3316.81s] you know the the the the military that i've worked with the brits that i've worked with
[3318.25s - 3323.21s] kind of to me represent what i think of when i want when i think of england and when i
[3323.85s - 3331.32s] the way i the way i kind of hold england and the uk in an elevated way in my mind the the
[3331.32s - 3337.40s] british military that i've worked with have maintained that standard completely professional
[3337.40s - 3346.09s] stiff upper upper lip squared away ready to work and just just really just professional
[3346.09s - 3353.61s] and that's the way i always think of england i'm interested here in the disciplining process
[3354.25s - 3360.17s] of getting married and becoming a father because you were someone who had already
[3360.73s - 3368.01s] worked hard on being disciplined but this feels like a very different type of discipline to the
[3368.01s - 3376.81s] discipline to put up with a baby that won't stop crying it's the discipline to be able to comfort
[3376.81s - 3384.12s] somebody while you're away from them that to me feels like a different sort of frequency
[3384.76s - 3391.72s] of of discipline and i'm interested in what you found as a challenge and what you found as
[3392.68s - 3400.28s] whether your military career had prepared you for marriage and fatherhood effectively
[3403.23s - 3409.15s] well first of all a insane amount of credit goes to my wife who
[3410.51s - 3417.69s] is just she one of the things i've tried to explain to people about her is that she was
[3417.69s - 3430.32s] emotionally independent meaning she didn't need me to to bolster her up and she handled everything
[3430.32s - 3435.52s] she handled everything on the home front literally everything and i would just go
[3435.52s - 3444.56s] and go do my job and she never complained about that she never made any comments about it it was
[3444.56s - 3453.28s] she knew kind of the priority for me was my job and that later on in life and and that strategically
[3454.40s - 3460.00s] in our lives the the priority was the family but she also knew that while i was in the seal teams
[3460.00s - 3464.96s] that was my number one priority she knew that and i told her that and she said yeah i know
[3464.96s - 3470.25s] i get it do you take care of your team you take care of your platoon you take care of your task
[3471.21s - 3474.97s] and i got this i got these kids in this house and all that other stuff
[3475.93s - 3483.26s] and she never complained she never she just she just did it and so the the majority the
[3483.26s - 3489.18s] vast majority of credit goes to my wife for being an awesome human being an awesome mom to our kids
[3490.06s - 3498.06s] and i was i would love to give you some kind of this is what you need to look for and i
[3498.06s - 3503.34s] that's probably the best i could do but i can't say that i looked for it i got very very lucky
[3504.30s - 3512.88s] i got very lucky that my wife was was look you can judge her looks and i obviously she was
[3512.88s - 3521.84s] and is a beautiful woman but the luck part was she was like i said emotionally independent
[3521.84s - 3530.80s] she was strong to be able to handle just just mayhem mayhem on a pretty regular basis you know
[3530.80s - 3538.96s] not you know from from having a bunch of kids to i'm gone on deployment and my wife is going to
[3538.96s - 3546.51s] visit my wounded guys in the hospital or going to my guys funerals that's what she was doing so
[3549.32s - 3556.52s] you know team effort for sure but she's the mvp and i'm just sort of you know the the bench the
[3556.52s - 3568.83s] bench warmer over here the now all that being said the the you know from the military look
[3568.83s - 3573.95s] taking ownership of things which which i already talked about a little bit but there's nothing
[3573.95s - 3580.19s] really that goes on in my family that i don't that that i would say no to my wife no that's
[3580.19s - 3585.31s] your fault because i can just about guarantee that everything is my fault when when there's
[3585.31s - 3591.24s] something that's not right when there's something going wrong it's something that i it's a mistake
[3591.24s - 3598.20s] that i made i did something wrong de-escalation right because my wife while borderline saint
[3599.16s - 3603.64s] there you know she's a human being a lot of my friends would argue that she's just a saint but
[3603.64s - 3607.88s] she is a human being and you know she might get mad about something she might get frustrated with
[3607.88s - 3618.81s] me about something and being able to de-escalate those situations and not not escalate them is
[3618.81s - 3624.41s] very very beneficial and one of the best ways to do that is by taking ownership when something goes
[3624.41s - 3629.45s] wrong so i would say the de-escalation part taking ownership is definitely beneficial
[3629.69s - 3637.68s] if you're blaming your your wife you're probably that's not going to work out great and and just
[3637.68s - 3645.34s] the idea of you know trying to win trying to win an argument i mean first of all honestly i don't
[3645.34s - 3652.78s] really or i i i don't really argue with my wife i probably have been in less than a handful less
[3652.78s - 3658.78s] than three or four arguments in my life with my wife and i can't even i can't even really think of
[3658.78s - 3664.68s] any right now i'm just don't want to you know try and try and make myself out or make our relationship
[3664.68s - 3670.92s] out to be something that's not but we don't really argue very often and so i can't even really say
[3670.92s - 3675.80s] that hey don't try and win an argument with your wife because i'm not really having an argument
[3675.80s - 3683.60s] with my wife um i i guess my i guess my synopsis of this is pay attention to who you're going to
[3683.60s - 3692.80s] get married to and try and pick someone that is emotionally independent that has their own
[3693.68s - 3701.20s] has their own that can handle life by themselves and that that can be that can make some people
[3701.20s - 3706.56s] feel insecure right i want someone that's relying on me all the time and i want them to feel like
[3706.56s - 3711.84s] they need me and that might be a trap for you if that's what you set yourself up with so
[3712.16s - 3717.05s] that's what i do find someone that's emotionally independent find someone that you get along well
[3717.05s - 3727.16s] with find someone that's that's um calm you know someone that's not you know that's not
[3727.16s - 3733.08s] going to get get bent out of shape about little things and if they do a little de-escalation can
[3733.08s - 3738.54s] kind of get the problem solved and then just uh have fun you know my wife and i have fun
[3739.10s - 3743.90s] and i think that's important it's very interesting to think about the fact that
[3743.90s - 3752.24s] some people rely on a partner who is overly vulnerable uh or um overly anxiously attached
[3752.96s - 3758.64s] as a way to bolster their unsensory assurance in a relationship i've seen this quite a lot
[3758.64s - 3765.52s] yeah that's probably not going to be a great move and look you a person i don't know everyone
[3765.52s - 3771.52s] all i can do is talk for myself and i would recommend you find someone that's more you're
[3771.52s - 3776.67s] equal someone that you can engage with someone that's someone that you're part of a team with
[3776.67s - 3781.71s] rather than someone that you're sort of domineering over i learned this the other day that there's
[3781.71s - 3789.50s] only one sentence in the bible about how you should choose a partner and it says that you
[3789.50s - 3798.60s] should choose someone that you could go to war with i like it that works that's legit it's a team
[3798.60s - 3804.60s] effort a relationship right and would you purposefully choose a particularly vulnerable
[3804.60s - 3811.87s] teammate because you're always going to be the person that's out in front probably not yeah
[3811.87s - 3820.03s] yeah now to push back a little bit about that look you there's guys i would be number one on
[3820.03s - 3825.90s] my list to go to war with that probably you're not going to be the best spouses in the world
[3825.90s - 3830.06s] you wouldn't get in relationship with them they're they're going to be they're going to be tough for
[3830.06s - 3837.02s] for a female to be married to because they're they're wild right they're wild animals and
[3837.02s - 3841.26s] they're the exact type of person that you would want to go to war with and that i've gone to war
[3841.26s - 3848.22s] with and a lot of times they're they're not going to be great as as husbands fair point yes yeah uh
[3850.81s - 3855.77s] people as well i've been thinking recently i spoke to andrew huberman last week and he was
[3855.77s - 3862.49s] explaining to me about the similarities between the grief process and the breaking up process
[3862.49s - 3870.91s] currently neurologically it's incredibly similar it's a distance in time and space and something
[3870.91s - 3874.83s] else i think and he was talking about how when you go through a breakup it is the same
[3876.03s - 3882.67s] networks that are activated as through grief and as somebody that has been to probably far more
[3882.67s - 3889.53s] military funerals than you can remember or would have liked to how does that inform
[3890.59s - 3895.55s] your advice for people letting go of people that they lose in their life whether that be
[3895.55s - 3903.12s] through a breakup or through them passing i talked about this on my podcast one time and
[3904.08s - 3908.08s] speaking of jocco videos that are out there and people have made videos of this
[3909.52s - 3918.04s] yes i have definitely lost too many of my friends and it took me a little while to start
[3918.04s - 3923.24s] getting pattern recognition on what what happens and it's a very clear pattern and
[3923.24s - 3929.80s] once i kind of put that out there i've now heard from many many scores of people that yep that's
[3929.80s - 3934.76s] what it feels like and i think if you know what it's going to feel like just like anything else
[3934.76s - 3940.44s] if you know what to expect then it's easier to contend with so it's like a storm that is hitting you
[3942.22s - 3946.54s] you know you lose someone someone that you know dies you are going to get put into a storm
[3947.18s - 3952.22s] and what's scary about it is it's an emotional storm and you have no control over it so you're
[3952.22s - 3956.70s] going to break down start crying you're going to remember bad things good things you're not
[3956.70s - 3959.90s] going to be in control of your emotions which is very difficult for adults because we're used to
[3959.90s - 3964.62s] having some level of control over our emotions so for a period of time you're going to get hit
[3964.62s - 3967.74s] with waves of emotion that you have no control over and they're going to knock you off your
[3967.74s - 3972.78s] feet and you're not going to be able to finish a sentence you're going to it's it's very very
[3972.78s - 3982.59s] difficult but over time that storm is going to fade a little bit and those those waves are going to
[3982.59s - 3989.44s] get weaker and and those waves still may come so i don't know if you've lost anyone that's close
[3989.44s - 3996.80s] to you no which is one of the reasons that i'm i'm an only child to parents like dogs dogs is it
[3997.36s - 4005.31s] so i have a particular um interest right so there's going to be times where it's been
[4006.27s - 4010.75s] a month since your friend died and you're going to be sitting there and you're going to hear a song
[4010.75s - 4016.27s] or you're going to smell a burger that you you you once had with this individual and you're
[4016.27s - 4020.11s] going to get overcome with those waves of emotion again and you might start crying right there you
[4020.11s - 4028.28s] might have this massive wave of emotion hit you and it'll and then it'll subside and over time
[4028.28s - 4034.41s] the waves will become weaker and they'll become less frequent and and here's where people also
[4034.41s - 4037.77s] get into trouble they think that that means that they didn't care about that person and that's not
[4037.77s - 4044.76s] true at all it's just that your mind is processing it and it's okay so that's what happens you start
[4044.76s - 4051.00s] off with these huge uncontrollable emotional storm that storm will pass that's number one just know
[4051.00s - 4058.92s] that that storm is normal and it's going to pass and then it's going to still hit you but over time
[4058.92s - 4065.96s] those waves of sadness and sorrow are going to get weaker and they're going to get less frequent
[4065.96s - 4073.16s] and that's okay that's a good thing and look i haven't broken up with a with a girl in a long time
[4074.28s - 4081.36s] but i you know when when people ask me about breaking up with girls is you know i've what
[4081.36s - 4089.72s] you have to do when it's not working with a girl is wish them luck to give them the best of luck
[4089.72s - 4095.05s] wish them luck walk away and don't look back and you're still going to get those emotions those
[4095.05s - 4098.33s] things are still going to hit you but walk away and don't look back and there's two reasons for that
[4099.05s - 4105.85s] number one if there's any chance that it's going to work out the best possible way for you to get
[4105.85s - 4109.85s] it to work out is by walking away by wishing them luck walking away and don't look back that's the
[4109.85s - 4119.47s] best way how so because if there is something there then she will let you know eventually and if
[4119.47s - 4122.99s] there's nothing there you're going to know that too because you never hear hear from her again
[4122.99s - 4129.23s] that's fine the protocol for getting her back is to walk away and don't look back that's the
[4129.23s - 4134.27s] protocol is to move on the protocol if she doesn't want you back is to walk away and don't look back
