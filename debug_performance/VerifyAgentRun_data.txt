  Textblock 1: [0.00s - 30.04s]  -Is this a complete and standalone motivational message suitable for a motivational shorts video?
     -Reason: This text is a personal reflection on adversity and success, self-contained and positive in promoting resilience and shared achievement without needing context, concise and punchy for a short video, avoids vagueness by focusing on personal growth and motivation, and would inspire without confusing listeners as it fosters a constructive mindset.
     -Decision: valid.
  Textblock 2: [98.89s - 121.22s]  -Is this a complete and standalone motivational message suitable for a motivational shorts video?
     -Reason: This text is a complete idea that stands alone, offering a clear and empowering message about the value of shared success and emotional regulation for joy, punchy and concise for a short video, avoids personal anecdotes, and would motivate without causing confusion.
  Textblock 3: [98.89s - 121.22s]  -Is this a complete and standalone motivational message suitable for a motivational shorts video?
     -Reason: This text relies on personal context ("her" and "this year's") that isn't universally relatable or self-contained, lacks positivity or inspiration as it doesn't motivate action or resilience, is vague and incomplete in isolation which could confuse listeners, and doesn't fit the punchy style needed for a motivational short video.

     -Reason: This text is a fragmented personal insight on performance and anxiety, heavily dependent on prior context (like "the best in the world" or "neuroticism"), would confuse a listener if isolated in a video; it lacks a clear positive, inspiring, or empowering idea to motivate action or resilience, is not concise or punchy but rather vague and negative without resolution; it's not suitable for a short video format.

create_motivationalshort(text="[205.54s - 211.00s] now and it's definitely gotten better you know I don't focus on perfection I focus on just being [211.00s - 215.66s] doing the best I can but even within that I have that voice in my head that will look at myself every [215.66s - 220.78s] now and then be like it's not that I'm a shitty person but if I'm trying to be mr lumpia like you're [220.78s - 225.84s] not fucking doing enough and it creates a like an impeding anxiety upon myself like I'm not doing [225.84s - 230.80s] enough and that's not like an overwhelming thing all the time it's it's a drive for me to keep being [230.80s - 236.14s] better and keep pushing more and more but it's a lot so I think being able to manage that is one of [236.14s - 240.40s] the most challenging things of maintaining success for an extended period of time you know there's two [240.40s - 244.92s] different mindsets when you win something there's oh I won I did it I'm done and then there's oh shit [244.92s - 250.18s] like I better I got to do better than this I won now I have to maintain this not only maintain this [250.18s - 255.10s] but this is the bare minimum of what's expected of me and I got to do better now so there's the [255.10s - 260.76s] balance of all that and I think over the last couple years I've been able to really be able to fix my [260.76s - 264.70s] perspective on just being grateful for the privilege of it you know there's times where I thought [264.70s - 269.54s] I was gonna stop competing because the pressure felt so high and then when I started to step away [269.54s - 273.40s] from it I was like fuck I would really miss this pressure like I have something I love about it [273.40s - 278.58s] something I love about being put back against the corner like knowing that there's a lot of work I have [278.58s - 281.90s] to do feeling like I can't accomplish my goal and you're gonna have to do it there's something so [281.90s - 286.42s] like simple and beautiful in the meaning of just doing something that difficult under that level [286.42s - 291.42s] pressure that you're choosing to do you know people say you find meaning in suffering and I think if you [291.42s - 296.32s] put yourself into like a meaningless suffering it's just it's dumb there's no point you're just [296.32s - 300.14s] hurting yourself for no reason but if you can find your meaning in just doing hard things that are as [300.14s - 304.60s] close as possible to suffering that you're still benefiting from and you still enjoy I think it's beautiful [304.60s - 310.64s] that's one of the vicious double-edged swords of having success if you have that kind of mentality")
create_motivationalshort(text="[378.45s - 384.96s] your self-esteem you're confident everything right all of that because if you're if there's even a part of [384.96s - 389.26s] you that's thinking well I'm going to do this I'm going to balance it because I want to feel satisfied [389.26s - 393.38s] I want to feel comfortable with myself and so on and so forth that's fine for as long as it contributes [393.38s - 398.66s] to your performance within the domain that you're competing in but as soon as you sacrifice any output [398.66s - 402.68s] in that that's just an opening for somebody else that's the competitor that's going to come in and get [402.68s - 409.52s] it yeah because I use this example of Eddie Hall world's strongest man uh 2017 or 18 I think [409.52s - 414.30s] and he's there you know he's worked hard toward this final goal he wins it once and he's crying [414.30s - 418.66s] and he's saying nana this is for you his grandma that passed away recently something like that and [418.66s - 424.44s] he says if he hadn't won that year he thinks that he would be dead divorced with no relationship to his [424.44s - 430.36s] kid because the weight he was at and the way he was pushing his body with pharmaceuticals and stuff [430.36s - 435.72s] was ridiculous he was working so hard and training so much that his relationship with his wife was [435.72s - 440.84s] in the toilet and he spent no time with his kid uh so you think okay in order for you to beat Eddie [440.84s - 444.44s] Hall you have to be prepared to sacrifice all of those things or not have them in the first place [444.44s - 450.72s] yeah it's powerful and that's what it comes down to like what [456.06s - 460.52s] are you willing to sacrifice at the end of the day you know people don't understand the level of [460.52s - 464.42s] sacrifice it's going to take and there's been moments where I realize that there are competitors [464.42s - 468.44s] I'm going against I'm sure and people in my league who are doing things that hurt their body more [468.44s - 472.30s] than I'm willing to do because I'm not the person anymore I can't say I'm willing to sacrifice [472.30s - 476.32s] everything to win the Olympia like hell no I have a family you know there's things I care about am I [476.32s - 482.00s] willing to sacrifice a lot my own like selfish mental peace and a lot of joy and a lot of things [482.00s - 486.60s] and working really hard absolutely but my health taking years off my life to not be with my family [486.60s - 490.98s] and stuff those are the things that kind of like make me better [490.98s - 496.58s] or worse I don't know but again you know I've always focused on building my own definition of what [496.58s - 501.84s] success means to me you know it's ink like you were saying in competition there will always be [501.84s - 505.64s] I'm trying to be the best in the world that means I need to beat these people that means I'm good [505.64s - 509.90s] enough or I'm not good enough in comparison to something external of myself but internally the [509.90s - 514.46s] values of the truth of which you hold in yourself of what really success means to you in your entire [514.46s - 518.88s] life though they're the things that you kind of have to balance and weigh out and kind of lean into")
