 [1388.48s - 1391.90s] You have the audience, you have all of these other things that are behind you, but at the
[1391.90s - 1395.44s] beginning, it's just you with a stick against a bear.
[1396.00s - 1401.50s] And arguably that fight is a harder fight to win than beating a dragon when you have a
[1401.50s - 1403.86s] nuclear bomb and six nations behind you.
[1403.98s - 1406.92s] And so it's not even like the, the size of the hardship.
[1406.92s - 1411.54s] It's just also the resources and how few of them you have and how so much of the beginning
[1411.54s - 1415.82s] is literally burning the one thing you have, which is time, because you have no leverage.
[1415.82s - 1417.78s] You don't have the money to pay other people to help you.
[1417.78s - 1423.34s] You don't have the resources to go like get someone to, to no one can learn it for you.
[1423.60s - 1426.32s] It's like, there's a lot of the things that, that we care about a lot.
[1426.38s - 1428.28s] Like no one can work out for you.
[1428.34s - 1429.36s] It doesn't matter how much money you have.
[1429.46s - 1431.20s] No one can learn skills for you.
[1431.28s - 1435.54s] And so in the early days, like it feels so painful because you're like, you look around
[1435.54s - 1436.42s] to see who can help you.
[1436.44s - 1438.10s] And then you're like, fuck, it's me again.
[1438.76s - 1443.50s] And I think getting comfortable with the idea that each of these things kind of like slum
[1443.50s - 1444.04s] dog millionaire.
[1444.04s - 1448.36s] If you've seen that movie where he, I'll give you the TLDR, he goes through his entire
[1448.36s - 1451.98s] life of randomness and he gets on the, who wants to be a millionaire version in India.
[1452.12s - 1454.60s] And from only 12 random experiences in his life that seemed meaningless at the time, was
[1459.92s - 1462.06s] he able to answer all of the questions and then ultimately win.
[1462.74s - 1467.32s] The skills that you develop along the way, like Steve jobs, learning calligraphy that then
[1467.32s - 1473.04s] became Apple fonts that, you know, transformed how we type those early days, that little
[1473.04s - 1478.80s] trench winning in the weeds oftentimes gives you these huge advantages later on because
[1478.80s - 1480.18s] you have more context than anyone else.
[1480.18s - 1486.32s] And so rather than lament them and hate the fact that you're going through it, remembering
[1486.32s - 1489.48s] that these will be arrows that you put in the quiver that you're going to be using to
[1489.48s - 1490.98s] slay the future, bigger dragons.
[1490.98s - 1498.28s] And so expecting it to be easy is what makes it much harder than it ever is.
