[795.31s - 801.35s] this so important? Why do you need to know what color the lens is that you view the world through? And more
[801.35s - 808.47s] importantly, why it's time to pop those lenses out if they don't serve you and put in different lenses so
[808.47s - 815.47s] that you can see things differently. I'll tell you why your mindset is so important. Because so much of
[815.47s - 823.00s] your potential is either limited or expanded by your mindset. I proved to you almost every single episode
[823.00s - 830.04s] on the Mel Robbins podcast, that with the right attitude and consistent action, you can absolutely change
[830.04s - 836.04s] anything about your life or your health or your relationships for the better. And if you're walking
[836.04s - 842.36s] around right now with a really negative mindset, you've got those dark bug-eyed glasses on, and
[842.36s - 847.54s] you're sitting there every single day telling yourself day in and day out that there is nothing that you
[847.54s - 852.08s] can do about this situation, this job, this relationship, this health condition that you've
[852.08s - 858.05s] tried, that you failed, that you don't deserve it, that you don't know how, I want you to consider
[858.05s - 866.23s] that your own mindset is keeping you stuck in that broken situation. Because your mindset is not
[866.23s - 872.80s] inspiring you to do anything about it. Being able to spot those dark lenses, pop them out, put in
[872.80s - 880.32s] something brighter, rosier, more luminous, it's going to change everything. And here's why. When you feel
[880.32s - 887.62s] more hopeful, or when you see options, and you start to tell yourself, well, why not? Why don't I just
[887.62s - 893.38s] try it? What if it works out? Why don't I just see what happens? I do deserve to be happier. I don't
[893.38s - 900.62s] deserve to be treated like this. I should start speaking up. That rosier mindset, it inspires you
[900.62s - 906.60s] to take the actions that change your life. And it's the actions that matter. This is why I love this
[906.60s - 913.10s] topic about mindset and what you're about to learn about the filter in your brain so much. Because right
[913.10s - 918.88s] now, there are areas in your life where your own mindset is blocking you from taking action. And


[918.88s - 923.36s] before we jump into the filter in your brain and changing your mindset, I want to be very clear about
[923.36s - 932.20s] something. This conversation today, it's not about positive thinking. You and I are talking about
[932.20s - 938.54s] training your mind to work for you. That's very different. This is not toxic positivity. I'm not
[938.54s - 944.02s] asking you to put a positive spin on a shitty situation. I'm also very clear that thinking
[944.02s - 950.54s] nice thoughts, it's not going to get your bills paid. However, if you can get serious and intentional
[950.54s - 957.34s] and strategic about training your mind to have a rosier and more optimistic and empowered attitude,
[958.47s - 966.19s] you, my friend, will be able to say to yourself, I can do this. You will be able to say, you know what?
[966.19s - 970.83s] I know my student debt is piled from the floor to the ceiling and I have not opened those bills in
[970.83s - 976.61s] approximately 10 months, but I believe in my ability to figure out how to pay this off.
[977.66s - 985.38s] If you can, that is an example of how you go from I'm fucked to I can figure this out. When you take
[985.38s - 991.74s] off the dark glasses, you know what you'll see? You'll see you're not stuck in the job. You're not
[991.74s - 996.22s] stuck in the relationship. You're not stuck with the unhealthy habits that you have. If you're the kind
[996.22s - 1001.56s] of person that constantly shrugs your shoulders and is like, well, it is what it is. Got this college
[1001.56s - 1007.04s] debt. It is what it is. I always date these losers. It is what it is. My grandfather was heavy. My mother
[1007.04s - 1013.78s] was heavy. I guess I'll just be heavy and feel really bad. No, no. You can look at something
[1013.78s - 1021.62s] differently. And when you look at it differently, you see different options. And I also want to say one
[1021.62s - 1026.52s] more thing before we jump into the filter in your brain and its connection to your mindset.
[1027.32s - 1033.22s] There are things in life that you are not going to change, or at least you're not going to change
[1033.22s - 1039.28s] them overnight. For example, you and I cannot change that there is discrimination in this world.
[1039.52s - 1046.82s] There is bias and there is violence that a lot of people experience. We cannot change the fact
[1046.82s - 1053.32s] that poverty and mental health issues impact people for real. But here's what you can do.
[1054.01s - 1061.89s] You can train yourself to look at the future and decide how you're going to react to and respond to
[1061.89s - 1068.31s] the things that you're facing in your life. You can decide how you're going to heal and what you're
[1068.31s - 1074.01s] going to do about those things for yourself and your community. And one final thing. We have a huge
[1074.01s - 1078.03s] global audience here at the Mel Robbins podcast. And I want you to know, if you're listening in
[1078.03s - 1082.45s] another country, that I am reading all of the questions that you're submitting through the DMs
[1082.45s - 1088.17s] and through the forums at melrobbins.com. And I see so many of you writing about your desire to
[1088.17s - 1094.11s] create a better life and the fact that it's hard because you're living in Iran or your country is
[1094.11s - 1100.07s] under siege like Ukraine. And I'm going to tell you something. A positive mindset is not going to change
[1100.07s - 1105.59s] the reality of what is going on around you. Here's what it does. And this is why it's important.
[1106.32s - 1115.75s] It empowers you to face it, to deal with it, and to survive it. That's what a mindset does.
[1116.43s - 1122.03s] And that's why it's important to get serious about training your mind to work for you.
[1122.03s - 1130.60s] And this connection between mindset and action, this is so important that I want to give you one
[1130.60s - 1140.96s] more example about how your mindset either inspires action or it discourages it. So let's just say
[1140.96s - 1151.91s] that you are in a job and you hate it. You feel stuck. You feel like you're kind of dead inside.
[1151.91s - 1158.79s] You're not excited about anything. It's day in, day out, the same thing. Or if you're not working
[1158.79s - 1164.71s] right now and let's say you've taken time off to raise your kids and you're sitting there going,
[1164.81s - 1169.23s] I want to get back in the workforce, but I don't have any skills and I've got a 20-year hold in my
[1169.23s - 1177.33s] resume. If your mindset is like those dark bug-eyed sunglasses that just muddy everything that you see,
[1177.33s - 1182.33s] this is what you're telling yourself. Nobody's going to hire me. I don't have any experience.
[1182.81s - 1187.35s] I don't even know how to write a resume. How the hell am I going to get into interior design when I went to
[1187.35s - 1191.89s] college for accounting and I work in a big accounting firm and I don't even know how to begin doing this.
[1191.93s - 1198.14s] I can't make this happen. If that is the way that you look at the future, if that's your mindset,
[1198.14s - 1204.74s] if you color what's possible through that dark lens, if you keep telling yourself those things,
[1205.10s - 1212.16s] you will see a world where you can't change. So are you going to feel inspired to work on your
[1212.16s - 1219.56s] resume? Of course not. Are you going to feel empowered to start Googling and researching and
[1219.56s - 1227.04s] figuring out how to go from an accounting job into interior design? No. Because your mindset
[1227.04s - 1233.04s] has stopped you before you even started. And that's why it's critical for you to realize this
[1233.04s - 1237.46s] is not just a conversation about your thoughts. At the end of the day, if you don't have a positive
[1237.46s - 1241.82s] mindset, you and I can talk about actions and habits all day long till we're blue in the face,
[1242.00s - 1247.74s] but you won't do shit about it. I got to get you to have the kind of mindset that also says,
[1248.14s - 1253.28s] hey, it's worth it. Hey, I can do something about this. Because if I can get you to be more optimistic,
[1253.28s - 1258.12s] if I can get you to take the dark lens off and put on a lighter one, if I can get you to start
[1258.12s - 1263.38s] believing, it is worth it for you to apply. It is worth it for you to put your dating app back up.
[1263.70s - 1267.68s] Yeah, it is worth it for you to pick up the pen and start working on that book you've always wanted
[1267.68s - 1272.50s] to write. Hell yes, it's worth it for you to take 10 minutes today and lay down on the floor and do
[1272.50s - 1277.32s] those stretching exercises that the doctor told you should do because you threw your back out instead
[1277.32s - 1282.38s] of sitting on the couch and bitching about it. Of course it's worth it. If I can get you to start to
[1283.28s - 1288.93s] oh, easy for you to say, Mel. Works out for you. Doesn't work out for me. It's not going to help.
[1289.01s - 1296.61s] I've had anxiety for years. If I can get you into, hey, maybe it will work. Hey, maybe I'm ready.
[1297.57s - 1305.37s] Maybe I should try this. Maybe I do deserve this. That singular switch in your mindset motivates you,
[1305.91s - 1313.97s] encourages you to take action. And that's critical. Because without action, your problems are not going
[1313.97s - 1320.21s] away. Without action, those dreams are not coming true. Without action, you are not healing the crap
[1320.21s - 1327.14s] that's giving you pain. When you change your mindset, it doesn't make those challenges disappear. It
[1327.14s - 1332.74s] changes your ability to face them. And so I'm going to teach you and I'm going to teach Brandy. Remember
[1332.74s - 1337.62s] that question? She wants, how do I reset this, Mel? How do I stop doubting myself? Well, I'm going to teach
[1337.62s - 1344.22s] you how to do a mindset reset because the fact is you can change your mindset. You are not stuck with
[1344.22s - 1349.44s] the thoughts that you think. You are not stuck with the way that you feel. You can make your mind a
[1349.44s - 1356.82s] place that supports you. Yes, you can start to see possibility where you never saw any possibility or
[1356.82s - 1363.86s] hope before. So now that you know what a mindset is and the fact that it impacts the actions that you do
[1363.86s - 1371.12s] or don't take, I now want to prove to you that your mind is super flexible. It is so easily programmed. I mean,
[1371.16s - 1378.74s] I can't even work my television remote and I can teach you how to change the filter in your brain. And your brain
[1378.74s - 1386.62s] right now is trying its best to change in real time to help you. And I'm going to prove that to you too. And I'm also
[1386.62s - 1393.20s] going to give you an example of just how flexible your mind is, how quickly you can change it. And when you start to
[1393.20s - 1402.68s] realize, holy cow, Mel's right, my mind is easier to program than a television remote. Holy cow, I never
[1402.68s - 1410.40s] even realized this. Just you buckle up and wait because your mind has been dying for you to learn what you're
[1410.40s - 1420.35s] about to learn. So let's prove to you that your mind is at the ready to change to help you. Okay. And I'm
[1420.35s - 1425.83s] going to give you an example that I am sure you have experienced in your life before. And here's the
[1425.83s - 1431.72s] example. Buying a new car. Have you ever had an experience where you either were looking or shopping
[1431.72s - 1438.52s] for a new car or you were in your family, somebody was, right? Or you became interested in a new car.
[1438.74s - 1445.58s] They're releasing this brand new Bronco, okay? And now you're super interested in it. I am personally in
[1445.58s - 1453.78s] this boat right now. I drive a nine-year-old car, 2014. I love this car, but it's time. It seems like
[1453.78s - 1460.74s] the engine light is on every other week. And every time I take it to get fixed, it's like a $500 bill.
[1460.96s - 1467.24s] And so the thing is paid off, but I'm like, you know, nine years, maybe it's time. It's getting to
[1467.24s - 1472.04s] the point. I love my car, but maybe I should get a new car. And the truth is I'm not really a car
[1472.04s - 1476.42s] person. I don't really give a shit about cars. I just want the car to be comfortable. I want it to
[1476.42s - 1480.60s] work. I want it to be reliable. I want the seats to have heaters in them and the steering wheel to be
[1480.60s - 1486.02s] a heater, seat, heater thingy. I always mix those words up, but I, that's kind of what I care about.
[1486.70s - 1494.50s] So I don't really think about cars, but you want to know what? The second I started truly considering
[1494.50s - 1500.12s] maybe it's time to get a new car. Do you know what I saw everywhere? I'm like, holy cow,
[1500.12s - 1504.66s] there are a lot of cars in this tiny town in Southern Vermont that I live in. Cars are everywhere.
[1505.18s - 1512.56s] And then as I started to hone in on the new Bronco, does everybody and their mother drive the new
[1512.56s - 1517.68s] Bronco? It's like, it's the only car on the road, the two door, the four door, the soft top, the hard
[1517.68s - 1524.61s] top, the gray one, the red one, the green one, like they're everywhere. Now here's the thing. A couple
[1524.61s - 1529.39s] months ago, when I was happily driving my nine-year-old car before the brake light has been on
[1529.39s - 1536.58s] consistently for three months, a few months ago, I had never seen a Bronco up here in Southern
[1536.58s - 1541.80s] Vermont. The only Bronco that I had ever seen was the one that my brother bought a year ago and he
[1541.80s - 1552.18s] lives in Chicago. But now that I'm interested in Broncos, I see them everywhere. And the second that
[1552.18s - 1558.26s] I got excited about that sort of silvery blue one with the soft top, I couldn't believe it.
[1559.36s - 1564.40s] Jessie, who runs video production for us, her husband drives one. I didn't even notice that
[1564.40s - 1569.54s] they had a Bronco. And now everybody has not only a Bronco, but that color. And I want you to think
[1569.54s - 1575.12s] about a time that this has happened to you, where you started to get interested in something.
[1575.12s - 1582.70s] And then it's like, whammo, overnight, you see it everywhere. Maybe it was a handbag that you were
[1582.70s - 1587.66s] really interested in, or a certain style of shoe or sneaker. You know, the new Converse ones with the
[1587.66s - 1593.34s] really like inch tall sole on them. All of a sudden, those things were everywhere. Or the Birkenstocks,
[1593.36s - 1598.88s] you know, the Birkenstocks that have the covered toe. It's like, those were popular 30 years ago, and
[1598.88s - 1607.88s] now every single college student and 20 something is wearing them. Uh, bangs. Uh, the second I wanted
[1607.88s - 1612.00s] curtain bangs, it's like, does everybody have curtain bangs suddenly? Everybody that I now see
[1612.00s - 1616.42s] has curtain bangs. Never even noticed them before. Or you hear a song and you tune in, you're like,
[1616.48s - 1620.64s] oh, I love that song. That song is so cool. And suddenly you hear the song playing in every restaurant.
[1621.42s - 1626.78s] Maybe you haven't shopped for a car, but I bet when you were looking at colleges, it's like,
[1626.78s - 1634.12s] wait a minute. Does everybody have a Michigan sweatshirt? Does everybody's parents go there?
[1634.48s - 1640.84s] Is there a sticker that says University of Michigan on every car? Is it just me? Or is that the only
[1640.84s - 1647.10s] college in town? It's the same thing if you want to have a baby. As soon as you are trying to get
[1647.10s - 1651.64s] pregnant, you know what happens? You see kids and pregnant women everywhere. It's like there were only
[1651.64s - 1656.60s] adults on the planet and people that weren't pregnant, and then you want a baby and boom, it's in



[1656.60s - 1662.90s] your face. Or how about this one? You want to fall in love. What do you see? You see couples in love.
[1663.14s - 1670.70s] It's so annoying. It happens instantaneously. You know what that is? That phenomenon where all of a sudden
[1670.70s - 1681.96s] overnight you see something everywhere. That is your mind changing in real time. That is a filter in
[1681.96s - 1691.38s] your brain paying attention to what it thinks you are excited about or interested in, and it's changing
[1691.38s - 1697.94s] what it's showing you in the world around you. And here's the crazy thing about your mind, and this is
[1697.94s - 1706.41s] why this science is so exciting when you understand it. Oh my God. Here's the crazy part. You ready?
[1706.41s - 1716.97s] The Broncos, the Bangs, the Birkenstocks, the Babies. They were always there all around you. You just
[1716.97s - 1723.40s] didn't notice them. You want to know why? Because they were not important to you. The fact that you
[1723.40s - 1733.50s] suddenly see those things everywhere, that is an example, and it is proof that your brain wiring is
[1733.50s - 1742.71s] changing in real time. And your mind is trying to help you. Your mind is showing you the Broncos that
[1742.71s - 1747.57s] have always been there. It's like it's highlighting it with a highlighter. Why? Because it became
[1747.57s - 1753.81s] important to you. Why would your mind let you see things sometimes, but not others? Why are you
[1753.81s - 1758.37s] suddenly seeing the covered toe Birkenstocks now, but you didn't see them for the last five years?
[1758.37s - 1766.06s] That's a great question. And this brings us to the topic of the filter in your mind. Oh, I'm so
[1766.06s - 1773.14s] excited for you to learn this. So there is a filter in your mind. It is called the reticular activating
[1773.14s - 1781.96s] system. The reticular activating system. I'm going to call this the RAS, okay? Here's the visual,
[1782.08s - 1788.28s] because you know your friend Mel loves visuals and metaphors to make this stuff easy. I want you to
[1788.28s - 1798.22s] imagine that there is a hairnet over your brain. This hairnet is a live network of neurons and it is
[1798.22s - 1808.76s] constantly changing in real time. And this RAS, this network of neuron hairnet that sits over your brain
[1808.76s - 1817.16s] as a filter, it has one job, a very important job, mind you. The RAS has to determine in real time,
[1817.16s - 1824.28s] I'm talking nanoseconds. What information it should allow into your conscious mind for you to see and
[1824.28s - 1831.00s] register and what information it will block out from your conscious mind. Another way that you can
[1831.00s - 1836.97s] think about the RAS is think about it like a bouncer in your brain. And the reason why you need a bouncer
[1836.97s - 1845.81s] is because life is sort of like a very popular nightclub. Everybody wants to get in. And because there's so
[1845.81s - 1852.57s] much and so many people and so many things showing up at a very popular nightclub trying to jam their way
[1852.57s - 1860.65s] in the door, you need a bouncer who is deciding who gets in and who has to stand in that long line
[1860.65s - 1867.49s] freezing their ass off in an outfit that is not appropriate for winter trying to get in, okay?
[1867.49s - 1875.65s] So let's go back to the example of the car and the purses and the babies and the University of Michigan
[1875.65s - 1883.55s] stickers that you suddenly see everywhere. The truth is all that stuff, all the cars on the road, all the handbags
[1883.55s - 1891.49s] people have, the hairstyles, it was already there. It was already in your subconscious. You quote, saw it,
[1891.49s - 1898.81s] but the RAS didn't allow you to register it. It shoved it right in that line. It did not let it
[1898.81s - 1906.54s] into your conscious mind. The RAS is the bouncer. It determines what is it that is important enough
[1906.54s - 1912.88s] to Mel Robbins that we are going to let it right in and have her think about it. Holy shit, there's
[1912.88s - 1916.80s] another Bronco. I'm not getting the blue gray color now because that's like the third one I've seen
[1916.80s - 1920.78s] today. In fact, I don't even know that if I want a Bronco anymore. And I don't think I want bangs
[1920.78s - 1926.58s] anymore either because it looks like every single person that I meet has bangs. This is how the
[1926.58s - 1933.52s] bouncer in your mind works. It literally has a guest list and you're the one that writes the guest list
[1933.52s - 1940.88s] out. What is on the guest list of your mind? Anything that is important to you, okay? All the other
[1940.88s - 1946.34s] yahoos that are not on the list, all the other colleges that are on stickers, on every other car,
[1946.34s - 1952.44s] Dartmouth, Harvard, Brown, University of Wittenberg, not even noticing those. Why? Because
[1952.44s - 1957.00s] you're thinking about University of Michigan. So all those other college stickers, they're waiting in
[1957.00s - 1960.96s] line. They're not getting in. That bouncer won't let them in. But boom, there's a University of
[1960.96s - 1967.86s] Michigan, short skirt. Come on, you're going in. That's how it works. And so this is super, super
[1967.86s - 1973.90s] important and it's really exciting, okay? It's really exciting because when you understand that
[1973.90s - 1979.86s] there's this electric hairnet on your brain called the RAS that works like a bouncer at a popular
[1979.86s - 1988.90s] nightclub, we can tell that bouncer what you want, who you want to let in. It's that simple.
[1989.26s - 1995.08s] And there's another important reason for the RAS and why you need a bouncer, okay? And the reason is
[1995.08s - 2002.38s] information overload. It's just impossible for the human brain to consciously process all the data
[2002.38s - 2008.84s] that is literally, that is coming in through all five senses. If you just take a second and look
[2008.84s - 2014.85s] around, and if you're driving a car, please do not take your eyes off the road. But look around
[2014.85s - 2021.83s] wherever you are right now. There is so much stuff all around you. Whether it's 50 license plates on
[2021.83s - 2028.35s] the road ahead, every single make and model of the car, road signs as you're passing, the speedometer,
[2028.35s - 2035.53s] the music input coming in, feeling your rear end on the seat, the air blowing out of the vents,
[2036.09s - 2042.94s] all that happening in a car. The perfume somebody's wearing, all that stuff is information coming into
[2042.94s - 2047.96s] your brain. If you're sitting at a home office or you're sitting at home, think about all the books.
[2048.08s - 2051.88s] I'm looking up at our production calendar. There's all these bazillion post-it notes and I've got Jesse
[2051.88s - 2058.16s] standing right there and I've got six chairs and my purse and, oh, there's a kitchen towel that I just
[2058.16s - 2066.62s] noticed on the floor of our office, just laying there. Just, I must've carried it up, just a dish
[2066.62s - 2075.97s] towel laying there in the office. Now I'm focused on it because I put my attention on it, but your RAS
[2075.97s - 2082.59s] cannot allow you to consciously process absolutely everything you can hear, smell, feel, taste.
[2084.76s - 2091.78s] What's the other one? Smell, taste, touch. Can't do it. Your head would explode. And so your RAS,
[2091.98s - 2098.86s] this, this bouncer with the list of what's important to you, it has to decide every nanosecond of every
[2098.86s - 2106.52s] day what it's going to let in and what it's going to block out. And so this is important because the way
[2106.52s - 2113.94s] that it programs what comes into your conscious mind is based on what it thinks is important to
[2113.94s - 2122.92s] you. That's it. What it thinks is important to you. And here is where the life-changing opportunity
[2122.92s - 2131.24s] is for you and me and everybody that you know. When you get intentional about purposefully telling
[2131.24s - 2137.62s] this bouncer what you want to see, whether it's Broncos or it's a certain handbag,
[2137.80s - 2146.92s] or heck, now it's the University of Colorado. That bouncer will change up the list. The RAS
[2146.92s - 2155.10s] reprograms itself in real time. It changes the filter. This is a live network in your brain.
[2155.79s - 2163.74s] It changes in real time to help you see those things that are important to you. That's what
[2163.74s - 2168.12s] you're experiencing when you suddenly see the car that you're interested in all over the road.
[2168.12s - 2176.18s] And today you're going to learn how to use that scientific neurological fact to your advantage
[2176.18s - 2183.71s] because you're going to give yourself a mindset reset. So let me recap what we've learned so far
[2183.71s - 2192.18s] because it's a lot. Number one, your mindset is like a pair of sunglasses. It filters the way you see
[2192.18s - 2198.80s] yourself, the world, your future, absolutely everything. Your mindset triggers whether or not
[2198.80s - 2204.94s] you take action or you don't take action at all. The second thing that you've learned is that when
[2204.94s - 2213.05s] you change the lens through which you view the world from something pessimistic and darker to a
[2213.05s - 2221.07s] worldview that is more rosy and action-oriented, it's going to lead to a happier and more action-oriented
[2222.27s - 2227.49s] according to both research and common sense. Third, you've now learned that there is this filter
[2227.49s - 2233.41s] in your brain, this super cool thing called the reticular activating system. It changes in real
[2233.41s - 2240.37s] time. It is flexible. It is alive. It is a network of neuron acting like a bouncer, keeping people out
[2240.37s - 2246.29s] of your mind, letting some things in. And right now, it's only acting based on what it thinks is
[2246.29s - 2253.01s] important to you. And fourth, you have learned that when you get serious and intentional about what you


[2253.01s - 2261.57s] want to see, whether it's babies or broncos or it's bangs, this filter in your brain will change
[2261.57s - 2269.66s] in real time to help you achieve it. Period. Full stop. This is science. Now, we're going to take a second
[2269.66s - 2275.63s] and hear a quick word from our sponsors. But when you come back to me, I'm going to explain how your
[2275.63s - 2284.19s] mindset is connected to that filter in your brain. And I have a super simple, really cool little tool
[2284.19s - 2291.89s] that you're going to start using today to put this science around your filter to work. And your brain is
[2291.89s - 2299.11s] going to start working for you. We'll be right back. Okay. So let me just set the table again. I like to do
[2299.11s - 2303.29s] that because when I listen to podcasts and I hear all the ads, I completely forget what we've talked about
[2303.29s - 2308.41s] by the time I get back to the show. So we've been talking about your mindset and we've also started
[2308.41s - 2312.95s] to scratch a surface at this thing called the reticular activating system. This is that live
[2312.95s - 2320.11s] filter in your brain that is flexible and capable of changing in a nanosecond to help you. So now I
[2320.11s - 2327.13s] want to go a layer deeper and I want to start to apply this flexibility in your filter to changing
[2327.13s - 2332.87s] your mindset. So let's start with this question from a listener named Peter. Hey, this is Peter from
[2332.87s - 2338.43s] Washington. I was just wondering, how do I get past my doubts and maintain a positive mindset?
[2338.85s - 2344.21s] Thanks, Mel. Thanks, Peter. So I want to focus on one aspect of your question, and that is where you
[2344.21s - 2350.73s] said getting past your doubts. This is where the science gets really interesting because your belief
[2350.73s - 2359.26s] about yourself is a mindset. I'm going to say that again. Your belief about yourself filters how you
[2359.26s - 2365.24s] see the world. And I'm going to give you an example. You use the word, Peter, self-doubt. If you have a
[2365.24s - 2372.80s] lot of self-doubt, you question yourself, you criticize yourself, you hold yourself back, what color do you
[2372.80s - 2379.10s] think the lenses on your sunglasses are? I'm not trying to be silly here. I'm trying to make this
[2379.10s - 2390.41s] intellectual topic very tangible and understandable. If you have a lot of self-doubt, what is the color
[2390.41s - 2398.30s] of the lenses on the sunglasses? Because this is where the filter in your brain starts to become
[2398.30s - 2404.96s] programmed by your mindset. Now I said earlier that your filter focuses on showing you what it thinks
[2404.96s - 2411.50s] is important to you. How does it know what's important to you? I'll tell you. I said earlier
[2411.50s - 2419.40s] that the RAS, that filter, its sole job is showing you what it thinks is important to you. So it begs
[2419.40s - 2424.73s] the question, right, Peter? If you haven't been intentional, at least you didn't think you were,
[2425.55s - 2429.33s] about telling the filter what to show you, how the hell does it know what to show you?
[2429.33s - 2436.66s] Well, it shows you whatever you spend your time, energy, thoughts, and attention focused on.
[2437.56s - 2445.00s] So going back to your question about self-doubt, if you doubt yourself, right, you put a lot of energy
[2445.00s - 2453.38s] into doubting yourself. It's not just one thought. You probably do it all day long. Your thoughts are
[2453.38s - 2459.64s] critical, you hesitate, you don't speak up, you hold yourself back. All of that is energy
[2459.64s - 2467.03s] energy that makes your RAS think that doubting yourself is important. If you doubt yourself
[2467.03s - 2472.77s] and you go into work, you know what happens to you at work? You don't see the 15 things that you do
[2472.77s - 2480.82s] right. You know what you obsess over? The one thing you've done wrong. That one email that you sent
[2480.82s - 2487.24s] that was a screw up, that one customer that you didn't quite do a good job with, the one thing you've
[2487.24s - 2494.26s] done wrong is all that you can focus on. Well, when you start to doubt yourself, this is where the
[2494.26s - 2501.56s] RAS starts to make it worse. Because your RAS sees you spending so much energy and mental fuel
[2501.56s - 2509.04s] in criticizing, doubting, and hesitating. And so your RAS thinks, oh my gosh, ding, ding, ding. Peter
[2509.04s - 2515.72s] thinks it's important for him to see what's wrong. And so your RAS blocks the 15 things that you did
[2515.72s - 2520.78s] right. You know what you did today, Peter? You sent 32 emails. Great job. You didn't see it though.
[2521.26s - 2524.76s] You did a great job with those five customers. You're not giving yourself credit though.
[2525.54s - 2530.24s] You were amazing in that meeting earlier. Not getting credit for that either. But the one email,
[2530.54s - 2535.36s] the one email, that bouncer's like, come to the front of the line. I'll take the email that is
[2535.36s - 2542.50s] negative with the short skirt and that email is getting in. Just like a dark pair of sunglasses,
[2542.50s - 2551.24s] shades everything. When you doubt yourself, it shades your mindset toward self-doubt. And then
[2551.24s - 2557.38s] your brain gets involved. When the email from your boss comes in, hey, can you stop by my office before
[2557.38s - 2563.34s] you leave today? How do you think Peter's RAS interprets that email? If he doubts himself,
[2563.92s - 2569.88s] I'll tell you how. When he reads, can you stop by my office before you leave today? His RAS goes,
[2569.88s - 2578.67s] oh shit. Because you've trained it to look for things that aren't right. By putting so much time
[2578.67s - 2585.79s] and energy into focusing on your self-doubt, you are also training the filter in your brain
[2585.79s - 2592.50s] to filter out everything that's going right and to focus only on the one thing that's going wrong,
[2593.04s - 2598.76s] thereby magnifying the self-doubt. Let's go back to an earlier example. Remember that pessimistic
[2598.76s - 2603.92s] friend sitting on the beach that's bitching that lunch hasn't come or that pessimistic relative
[2603.92s - 2612.96s] that is bitching about the family member that's halfway across the tent? It's all they see. They
[2612.96s - 2619.38s] can't even see the beautiful water or the happy couple or anything else good. Why? Because their
[2619.38s - 2628.10s] pessimism is what has programmed their reticular activating system. This is how mindset and the filter
[2628.10s - 2636.15s] in your brain get linked. They become fused together. All you see is the reasons you should doubt
[2636.15s - 2642.21s] yourself. It's how you feel. So first it starts with a mindset. You're thinking negative thoughts
[2642.21s - 2647.65s] and then your filter gets involved. And next thing you know, you're just seeing more and more and more
[2647.65s - 2652.75s] and more reasons to doubt yourself. And here's something that you may be thinking right now.
[2652.83s - 2659.34s] Why is my brain doing this to me? Why is my brain against me? Your brain is not working against you.
[2660.40s - 2667.32s] It's just responding to where your mindset and all your energy is going. That's it. It follows
[2667.32s - 2675.58s] your energy and your focus. And this is the good news, okay? If you get intentional about searching
[2675.58s - 2682.10s] for reasons to feel proud or for the small wins, the 15, 32 emails that you sent, the good things that
[2682.10s - 2688.50s] you did, the places where you're showing up, your mind will spin like a top. And all of a sudden,
[2688.50s - 2692.92s] just like you saw Broncos and babies and Birkenstocks, instead of seeing the one thing
[2692.92s - 2698.49s] that you did wrong, you will see the 15 things that you did right. This is not a joke. It's hard
[2698.49s - 2705.51s] science. This also, by the way, ties right back into the endless science about the power of a gratitude
[2705.51s - 2715.71s] practice. A gratitude practice is a way to train your mind. A gratitude practice is teaching the RAS
[2715.71s - 2722.21s] process that being grateful and taking times to savor beautiful moments and focusing on things tha


[2722.21s - 2727.61s] you're really proud of and you appreciate, that that's important to you so you see more of it.
[2728.03s - 2734.79s] That's how this all works hand in hand. And I want to give you one more example, okay? Because I think
[2734.79s - 2740.29s] this is challenging at times to see in ourselves because we're so used to seeing the world through
[2740.29s - 2746.20s] a certain lens that we don't even realize we're wearing sunglasses. But it is kind of easy to
[2746.20s - 2752.96s] spot in other people. So here's one more example about how your own beliefs and mindset about yourself
[2752.96s - 2761.41s] or a situation that you're in can become paralyzing because the filter in your brain keeps the mindset
[2761.41s - 2771.04s] in place, okay? So think about somebody that you love who's single and they are desperate to meet
[2771.04s - 2778.64s] the right person. And the longer they stay single, the more and more insecure they get by the day.
[2779.62s - 2785.32s] And when you see them, you see a person who is smart, who's awesome, who's hilarious, who's loyal,
[2785.44s - 2790.62s] who's sexy, who's amazing, who would be the most incredible person to be in a relationship with.
[2791.70s - 2802.52s] But I want you to just imagine that the color of the lens on your glasses, when you look through
[2802.52s - 2810.54s] your belief about them, it's completely different than the color of the lens on their glasses.
[2811.04s - 2816.90s] When day in and day out, all this person can think is, why can't I find somebody? I'll never find
[2816.90s - 2821.86s] somebody. Why does everybody else have somebody? I see all my friends getting approached at the bars.
[2822.00s - 2829.90s] I see my friends getting asked out. Why am I not getting asked out? What you've now learned about the
[2829.90s - 2836.70s] mindset and belief about yourself and the way your filter responds in real time is the more energy you
[2836.70s - 2841.46s] put into a negative narrative like this. It's never going to work out for me. Nobody's ever going to
[2841.46s - 2847.42s] love me. I am unlovable. Everybody else has a date. I'm never going to have a date. The more that mindset
[2847.42s - 2853.82s] and that belief becomes a self-fulfilling situation. Why? Because you're putting so much energy into the
[2853.82s - 2858.90s] negative that the filter in your brain is now going to filter the world in a way to reinforce the
[2858.90s - 2865.14s] negative story. When you walk into a bar, all you're going to see are all the couples. You're not even
[2865.14s - 2870.49s] going to focus on all the other people that are single that you should walk up and talk to. That's
[2870.49s - 2877.23s] the bouncer in your brain aligning with where your energy is. This also explains why you as the friend
[2877.23s - 2883.39s] see the opposite. And you can tell the person over and over and over again, you need to calm down.
[2883.95s - 2888.49s] Amazing. You are going to find an amazing person. It's not that you're not going to meet somebody.
[2888.57s - 2894.31s] You just haven't met the right person yet. It's the exact same situation. But because both of you
[2894.31s - 2899.45s] have different mindsets and beliefs about the situation, you see it through a different lens.
[2900.17s - 2909.08s] And you both believe, by the way, that your belief is the truth. And this simple example highlights how
[2909.08s - 2915.54s] your mindset and how you view the world impacts the filter in your brain. Because the more that this
[2915.54s - 2920.64s] carries on for your friend, the less your friend is going to put themselves out there. Because they're
[2920.64s - 2927.06s] slowly convincing themselves that this is never going to happen, so why bother? And the more that you see
[2927.06s - 2931.90s] them pulling back, the more that your belief is going to become, but you need to, but you're the one
[2931.90s - 2938.30s] holding your back. See the filter in your brain, it's either going to make the situation worse
[2938.30s - 2944.96s] or, and this is what I want to teach you, it can make it better. But that depends on your ability
[2944.96s - 2950.38s] to get serious about programming it. Because wouldn't you love it if your friend who wanted
[2950.38s - 2957.41s] to meet somebody would still have a positive mindset or a rosy outlook so that they don't just latch
[2957.41s - 2962.94s] on to some loser? Because you would probably do anything to make sure that this friend of yours,
[2963.00s - 2967.56s] this person that you love, would maintain a positive mindset and a rosy outlook. Why do you want them
[2967.56s - 2973.44s] to maintain that? I'll tell you why. Because your mindset dictates your actions. And if you can stay
[2973.44s - 2978.64s] positive, if you can stay optimistic, if you can keep saying to yourself, there is nothing wrong with
[2978.64s - 2983.08s] me. I just haven't met the right person yet. But one of these days, the right person will walk in,
[2983.08s - 2988.22s] and in the meantime, I'm just going to keep being me. If they can get intentional about creating that
[2988.22s - 2993.36s] mindset, a number of things are going to happen. They're not going to become insecure. They're not
[2993.36s - 2997.84s] going to start acting all weird around people. And they are not going to latch on to some loser just
[2997.84s - 3001.54s] because they're starting to convince themselves that they're desperate and this is their only option.
[3001.92s - 3007.26s] Because we both know that's not true. There's 8 billion people in the world. And right now,
[3007.26s - 3014.76s] the right one has not walked into your life, but they will, if you can maintain a positive attitude.
[3015.94s - 3021.04s] And the secret is training the RAS and catching your negative mindset and swapping it out for a
[3021.04s - 3027.86s] more positive one. Because as you're learning, the thoughts that you think dictate the world that you
[3027.86s - 3034.10s] see, the way that you feel, and the actions that you take. Noticing this, that you have a mindset
[3034.10s - 3038.62s] that's holding you back, that's the first step. Second, asking yourself if it's serving you,
[3038.86s - 3043.90s] that's the second step. And the third step, you just got to get serious about making your mind work
[3043.90s - 3050.22s] for you. Because you can. If you're breathing, you can change this. Even if your default is negative
[3050.22s - 3055.26s] and pessimistic, you can teach yourself to be optimistic. And I'm going to give you one more
[3055.26s - 3060.10s] example. If you are somebody that loves social media, if you've ever seen the Instagram
[3060.10s - 3066.52s] explore page or the TikTok discover page, you'll notice that it changes in real time. Because those
[3066.52s - 3073.92s] pages are filters. And they respond to what it thinks is important to you. So if you click on a
[3073.92s - 3079.54s] puppy, all of a sudden, that discover page, it's going to be all puppy videos. I went through this
[3079.54s - 3085.82s] phase where I was really into like long nails. And suddenly that discover page went from puppies to
[3085.82s - 3092.22s] long nails. And it doesn't matter if you accidentally click on Beyonce videos or on some other thing,
[3092.32s - 3097.52s] wedding videos. The algorithm is going to think that that's what you want to see. So suddenly that's all
[3097.52s - 3104.18s] that you see. And it becomes this self-fulfilling prophecy. Your brain's the same way. Once you focus
[3104.18s - 3111.22s] on something, your brain starts showing you more. My daughter had this huge breakthrough about how she
[3111.22s - 3117.78s] felt about herself based on social media and on her brain. Because she realized, oh my God, my
[3117.78s - 3123.76s] explore page, it's all fitness models. And it's fitness models that are in photos of waist trainers
[3123.76s - 3129.72s] and wearing body makeup and taking these crazy filtered photos in these contorted positions to make
[3129.72s - 3134.34s] themselves look like they have a waist that's two inches small. I mean, of course she felt like shit
[3134.34s - 3141.22s] about her body. Why? Because she was seeing it over and over and over again. And so her brain started
[3141.22s - 3145.58s] thinking, oh, well, this must matter to you. And then the social media pages start aggregating it and
[3145.58s - 3150.38s] showing you more and more and more. And so as that all starts to happen, you start to believe that
[3150.38s - 3155.02s] everybody on the planet is the size of your pinky finger, which then of course invalidates the fact
[3155.02s - 3161.50s] that you have this big, beautiful, amazing, strong body, and you look fabulous, but it doesn't matter
[3161.50s - 3166.41s] because it doesn't match all this crap that's being shown in your face. This is how your brain works


[3166.41s - 3173.77s] too. And you got to get on top of this. So before we walk through the mindset reset process, when
[3173.77s - 3180.00s] these thoughts pop in, here's a pro tip. Get serious about what accounts you follow. I mean, you definitely
[3180.00s - 3184.78s] want to follow the Mel Robbins podcast to Mel Robbins because everything we put up is a way to train
[3184.78s - 3190.36s] your brain to work for you. But when we come back, I'm going to give you the simple exercise backed by
[3190.36s - 3196.35s] your research that is astonishing. Because when you start to put it to use, you will experience your
[3196.35s - 3203.62s] brain changing in real time. Welcome back. We've been talking about mindset, the filter in your brain
[3203.62s - 3211.50s] called the RES and how to give yourself a mindset reset. Look, I want to also say one thing to you. This
[3211.50s - 3218.28s] stuff is kind of heady. So I'm doing my best to keep this like fun and visual because when you get lost
[3218.28s - 3223.16s] in thought, it's going to be hard to apply this. And so first of all, I want to commend you for
[3223.16s - 3227.46s] sticking with this because now we're going to dig into the exercise. I wanted you to have the
[3227.46s - 3234.32s] understanding because oftentimes I personally find that if somebody just throws a science back tip or
[3234.32s - 3239.58s] exercise or tool or tactic or strategy at me, it sounds so dumb on the surface that without the
[3239.58s - 3245.46s] underlying kind of research and mechanics and science that explains why this simple thing works,
[3245.46s - 3252.08s] you will literally roll your eyes and not do it. So now that you have that background, I'm going to
[3252.08s - 3258.84s] reward you with the exercise that I want you to practice. And this one is simple. So if you're
[3258.84s - 3264.44s] cynical, if you're really smart, if you're analytical, it will sound stupid. But I want you to hang in there
[3264.44s - 3272.46s] because there is a really powerful thing going on in your neural pathways when you try this. And it's also
[3272.46s - 3278.82s] an incredibly cool and fun thing to do with your family, with your friends. In fact, I get texts from
[3278.82s - 3284.20s] people all over the world who are doing it. And my kids who do not live with us are two adult daughters.
[3284.34s - 3291.00s] They constantly text me pictures of what I'm about to ask you to do. So I promise you it's worth trying.
[3291.56s - 3300.32s] This is an exercise called looking for hearts. And this is how you play it. Every single day when you
[3300.32s - 3307.48s] wake up, you are going to go on a scavenger hunt in your day to day life, and you are going to try to find a
[3307.48s - 3313.62s] naturally occurring heart shape somewhere in the world. It could be a cloud that's shaped like a heart.
[3314.02s - 3319.24s] You could look at your coffee and see that the foam on top has made the shape of a heart. You might get out of
[3319.24s - 3325.68s] your car, and you'll see a stain on the floor or a leaf that's the shape of a heart. I constantly,
[3325.68s - 3331.84s] constantly see rocks. I see heart shapes in the top of mountain ranges. I see the shape of hearts
[3331.84s - 3337.46s] in brick buildings all the time in terms of the different colors of bricks. And here's what's
[3337.46s - 3346.49s] interesting about this. What you'll realize is that there are probably 10,000 heart shapes that are
[3346.49s - 3351.77s] around you in your day to day life. The stain on the carpet, the spot on your dog's back,
[3351.77s - 3359.23s] the tear in a pair of pants, the shape of a leaf. They're everywhere. They're absolutely everywhere.
[3359.57s - 3365.54s] And right now, you walk right by them. Why? Well, because they're not important to you. You have not
[3365.54s - 3372.44s] told the bouncer of your brain to let the hearts in to the nightclub. So you are walking right past all
[3372.44s - 3380.48s] these things, and they are actively being blocked out. It is not in your conscious mind. The second you
[3381.90s - 3389.66s] find a heart, you will experience something amazing. You will experience your brain going to work for
[3389.66s - 3396.10s] you. And so here's how I want you to play this, because I do want you to play this every single day.
[3396.54s - 3403.98s] This is truly not a game about finding hearts. This is about training your mind. This is a game where you
[3403.98s - 3411.38s] are telling your mind, I am the freaking boss. Bouncer of the mind, I pay your salary. You are going to do
[3411.38s - 3417.64s] what I tell you to do. You are going to find me a heart. And if you want to get paid, you are going
[3417.64s - 3424.20s] to find me a heart. That is your job today. Find me a heart. So get intentional about that. And then
[3424.20s - 3435.14s] I want you to go through your life and just let a heart shape in. And when you see it, here's what I
[3435.14s - 3439.14s] want you to do. And if you're really analytical, you're going to think this is the cheesiest damn thing
[3439.14s - 3443.62s] you've ever heard. But I want you to do this because there's neuroscience involved. When you
[3443.62s - 3449.58s] see that heart, I want you to pause. And I want you to really stare at it for a minute. You can take
[3449.58s - 3456.04s] a photo of it. If it's a rock, you can pick it up or a leaf and take it with you. Because I want you
[3456.04s - 3465.77s] to reward your brain for being flexible and for trying to help you. I want you to take that moment
[3465.77s - 3473.09s] for real, as cheesy as this sounds, the foam on the top of your coffee, the shadow on the floor.
[3473.45s - 3480.40s] I want you to take a minute and really savor it and literally just go, holy shit, there it is.
[3480.96s - 3486.56s] That's pretty cool. Yesterday, I walked right past this and I didn't even see it. Thank you, mind.
[3487.04s - 3494.52s] Wow. You just changed in real time. You just let something in that I asked you to let that in.
[3494.52s - 3499.52s] And if you really want to supersize this, if you're somebody that's really struggling with a sense of
[3499.52s - 3509.99s] self-worth or hope or really believing that you can turn things around, I want you to look at that
[3509.99s - 3518.42s] and tell yourself that that was placed there for you to find. That this was placed there because you
[3518.42s - 3527.44s] needed to see evidence that it is in fact possible to change the way you think. It is in fact possible
[3527.44s - 3534.52s] to tell your mind what you want to see more evidence of and for your mind to work for you.


[3535.15s - 3542.43s] And once you see one heart, you will start seeing hearts everywhere. The more hearts that you see,
[3542.43s - 3549.57s] the more that you are connecting into magic, the more that you realize that your brain is trying
[3549.57s - 3554.55s] very hard to help you, it is going to point out hearts in the moss. It's going to point out hearts
[3554.55s - 3559.23s] on the sidewalk. You're going to see hearts on people's clothing. You're going to see them in
[3559.23s - 3566.03s] paintings. It's weird. They're like everywhere. It's as if there is this entire world that you and I live
[3566.03s - 3572.71s] in. And we walk by it every single day. And I think that's true about everything that you want.
[3573.37s - 3578.91s] That there is evidence all around you that things are working out, that people are trying to help
[3578.91s - 3584.63s] you if you're willing to see it. You know, at the end of the day, finding hearts is not about finding
[3584.63s - 3590.67s] hearts. It is about something so much bigger because it's proof that you can change the wiring in your
[3590.67s - 3597.83s] mind. You can manipulate and program this filter, the RAS, to make it work for you. And every time
[3597.83s - 3604.55s] you see a heart, it is evidence that it is true. And so it's important because this is the first step
[3604.55s - 3614.01s] of a mindset reset. Because if you didn't think, hmm, my mind can change. It can allow me to see
[3614.01s - 3620.88s] the world differently. If I can't get you to see and experience that, you will never even bother
[3620.88s - 3628.38s] trying thought substitution. And I will say there is something that some of you may experience.
[3628.72s - 3637.98s] So this comes from Nadie in Germany. And she wrote, you know, Mel, I loved what you said about looking
[3637.98s - 3643.76s] for hearts. And I've been trying it. And I even saw two hearts within an hour. But then I got nervous
[3643.76s - 3651.95s] and was almost afraid to find them. So how do you overcome the fear of making things
[3651.95s - 3662.24s] better? I relate to this. Because we're used to the way that things are. We're used to the default
[3662.24s - 3669.31s] programming in our minds, even if it makes us miserable. And when you start to catch a glimpse
[3669.31s - 3678.28s] of how things could be different, I think sometimes if you've experienced a tremendous amount of heartache
[3678.28s - 3686.69s] or you've tried so many times to put yourself out there, the idea of believing again, that it's worth
[3686.69s - 3697.47s] trying again, that that is what's scary. Here's what I have to say to you. This is not about hope.
[3698.74s - 3707.57s] This is hard science. Because you're living with programming right now. And I am here to tell you
[3707.57s - 3716.78s] it's outdated. In fact, when you start to really play around with this next piece of how you change
[3716.78s - 3722.69s] the way that you think, you're going to realize that you're not even listening to your voice.
[3725.06s - 3732.37s] You're listening to someone else's voice. It's probably your mom's or your dad's or another
[3732.37s - 3742.29s] caregivers. Because that negativity that's in your mind that chips away at you, that default programming
[3742.29s - 3749.58s] that you don't even really hear. For me, I call it my campaign of misery. I did not create this
[3749.58s - 3756.34s] when I was six or seven or eight. I was taught this. And so you're going to start to realize that
[3756.34s - 3759.96s] not only do you have the power to change the filter. Yes, you can see reasons to be happy.
[3759.96s - 3766.30s] Yes, you can spot wins instead of reasons why you're a loser. Yeah, you can pay more attention
[3766.30s - 3769.76s] to the people in your life that make you feel great instead of chasing the ones that make you
[3769.76s - 3776.12s] feel like crap. You can change all of this. You can make your mind work for you. But what you're
[3776.12s - 3780.16s] going to realize very quickly is, holy cow, like there's this default thing in my mind that's like
[3780.16s - 3787.80s] fighting my desire to be happy. It's fighting my desire to win. And so that's where we're going to go
[3787.80s - 3793.26s] next. Because there is an entirely different reality. One of the reasons why I always say to
[3793.26s - 3799.77s] you is, I love you. I believe in you. I believe in your ability to create a better life. The reason
[3799.77s - 3805.43s] why I say that to you all the freaking time, and I mean it, is because I know you don't say that to
[3805.43s - 3811.29s] yourself. And I didn't say that to myself for a long time either. And I don't need to meet you
[3811.29s - 3821.33s] to say, I love you. Because love is a verb. Love is how you show up in the world. This podcast is an
[3821.33s - 3828.61s] act of love for me. It is a way to connect with you. It's a way for me to support you and empower you.
[3829.57s - 3834.75s] And I show up here because I do believe in you. I don't care what's happened to you. You cannot
[3834.75s - 3840.49s] convince me that you cannot change. I have way too much evidence on my side. You only have your
[3840.49s - 3846.33s] experience. I've got an army of a million people that I've seen change. And so I know you can change.
[4672.64s - 4678.04s] wrong. You can spend more time with people that make you feel good instead of chasing places you
[4678.04s - 4685.87s] really don't like. All of this is possible. And I want this for you, which is why I hope you'll try
[4685.87s - 4692.21s] this. And simple reframes if you don't feel good enough is you can be like, I'm a work in progress.
[4692.45s - 4698.11s] I can figure it out. The people who love me are the people who I need in my life. This is
[4698.11s - 4706.64s] important. I really hope you take this on. And this is the work that you'll do for the rest of your life.
[4706.78s - 4715.11s] And it's worth it because the happiest days of our lives are the road ahead of us. Truly. I want
[4715.11s - 4721.49s] that for both of us. And I've spent far too much time beating myself up and looking for what's wrong
[4721.49s - 4728.51s] and searching for reasons to feel tortured or lonely and to stop myself. It's just horse shit. I'm so sick of
[4728.51s - 4733.83s] it. And I'm sure you're sick of it too. And you know, I'm sharing all this because even though I
[4733.83s - 4741.36s] teach this stuff, it's easy stuff to listen to or talk about. You got to put it into practice. And
[4741.36s - 4747.97s] so do I. You got to catch yourself when the negativity starts. You got to cut off the voice
[4747.97s - 4753.43s] in your head that is not your own. You got to knock this middle school shit off and start claiming your
[4753.43s - 4758.69s] adult life. Because you do deserve to be happy. And even if you don't love yourself, I'll tell you
[4758.69s - 4764.77s] what, I love you. Even if you don't believe in yourself, that's okay. I believe in you. And I'm
[4764.77s - 4770.97s] going to keep on saying it until you catch up with me. Because I do believe that you can take the steps
[4770.97s - 4776.79s] to reprogram your mind. You can take the steps to shut up that negativity in your head. You can take the
[4776.79s - 4785.23s] steps to filter the world in an entirely new way and see how it's working to help you. And it doesn't
[4785.23s - 4794.29s] take a whole lot of time to create a better life. Now go find a heart. I love you. Oh, one more
