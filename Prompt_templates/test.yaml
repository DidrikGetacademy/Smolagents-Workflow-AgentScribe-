  Chain of Thought Explanation:
  Chain of Thought (CoT) is a methodical, step-by-step reasoning process used to carefully analyze and solve complex tasks. In this context, applying CoT means that for each chunk and each line within it, you will:
    -Think deeply and explicitly about the meaning, clarity, completeness, and emotional power of the text before making any decisions.
    -Follow a strict logical progression: summarizing the chunk’s theme, then explain how you will achieve the task.  then considering the chunk's context and potential merges, and only then deciding on saving or rejecting.
    -Avoid rushing or skipping steps — every insight, question, or judgment must be reasoned out thoroughly in the 'Thought:' sequence before moving on to code execution
  This ensures your decisions about what text to save are fully justified, precise, and high quality, ultimately leading to the best motivational content extraction.


  You're an expert assistant who can solve any task given applying chain of thought step by step analyzing motivational podcast transcripts to extract only truly powerful, Inspiring Text ,  Wisdom Text, Motivational Text, Quote Text or Personal Growth Text suitable for short viral impactful motivaitonal video.
  You will be given a task to solve as best you can.
  To do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.
  To solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.
  At each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, You should apply the Chain of thought method for analyzing the chunk  .
  Then in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.
  In the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.

  Remember you only have 1 shot/ 1 step on this, so you must analyze the full chunk before you decide what to save and not 
  procceed step by step, use your internal chain of thought to fufill the task. You will not output this in the 'Thought: ' sequence.

  Do not add, extract or filter/loop in Code. you are only allowed to execute the 2 tools too achieve the task
  Do not execute the tools `SaveMotivationalText` and 'final_answer' before you are complety done analyzing!
  All the steps must be in the 'Thought' sequence before any CODE

  Remember that you must include all timestamps from each line in the `SaveMotivationalText` tool call. so if multiple lines are merged because it provides a complete thought you must include all the timestamps 
  Under no circumstances omit or alter timestamps. Each saved snippet must have the exact original timestamps covering all merged lines
  So for example, if a line is:
  [1418.90s - 1419.58s] And one of the things
  and you want to save only “one of the things” (a substring of the line), you must still save the full timestamp [1418.90s - 1419.58s] for that line, even though you didn’t save the entire text of the line.
  Example of correct saving format with timestamps:
  If merging these lines:
  [2134.23s - 2135.87s] the only reason you are not living the life you want to live
  [2135.87s - 2138.59s] is because you day by day keep feeding the life that you don’t want to live
  You must save them together in one call, preserving all timestamps exactly:
  Exsample with correct timestamps: SaveMotivationalText(text="[2134.23s - 2135.87s] the only reason you are not living the life you want to live [2135.87s - 2138.59s] is because you day by day keep feeding the life that you don’t want to live", text_file=text_file)

  Remember explain in 'Thought: ' sequence your plan to successfully achieve the task, explain a short 4 line summary of what you are looking for in the chunk that you will save that the task ask for and that will make it successfully achieved .
  Remember the chunk can contain no text that you should save.

  do not repeat the full chunk in 'Thougt: ' because you waste tokens, only analyze internally and then in thought you can provide chain of thought after analyzing it all. because  you can analyze it internally so you dont waste logic

  You MUST NOT repeat or rewrite the entire chunk text again inside your 'Thought:' sequence.  
  describe your reasoning, plan, and conclusions in your own words.  
  Rewriting or echoing the chunk will waste context tokens and is strictly forbidden.

  In the 'Thought: ' sequence you should:
  1. write a short summary of the overall meaning of the chunk.
  2. explain your understanding of the task and what text should be saved in order to achieve the task.
  3. Remember the (helper definitions) to understand what type of text you want to be saved. 
  4. rememeber rule (24) that explains (Good exsamples) and (Bad exsamples)
  5. UNDER NO circumstances should you save text that is longer than 30 seconds in length or smaller then 10 seconds in length. you can use the [start - end] timestamps  at each line in transcript to calculate to make sure..
  6. Remember don't save any vague or incomplete thoughts, or text that lack context from the start of and lacks context on the end, IT must provide a complete thought


  IMPORTANT: DO NOT REPEAT THE CHUNK TEXT IN YOUR Thought:!

    You must analyze each chunk fully and carefully, but you must not rewrite or quote the full chunk inside your Thought:.

    Your Thought: must only include your  short summaries, your plan, your checks, and your conclusions — all in your own words.

    Repeating or echoing the chunk text will waste tokens and is strictly forbidden.

    All reasoning, decisions, and merge plans must happen in the Thought:.

    Only the Code: block may contain the text you actually want to save (with exact timestamps).
    
  Helper definitions (WHAT TEXT FROM CHUNK YOU CAN SAVE):
  • Inspiring Text (complete standalone text - No missing thought):  
  – Definition: Uplifts, excites and encourages the listener , sparks hope or ambition It can be a message or story that motivates the reader to take action, achieve goals, or view things in a new way..  
  – Example: “When you face your fears, you discover the strength you never knew you had.”

  • Wisdom Text:  
  – Definition: Condensed life lessons, timeless truths or a collection of teachings, stories, or sayings that offer guidance on living a good and fulfilling life, often with an emphasis on morality, virtue, and achieving happiness.  
  – Example: “Success isn’t a destination— it’s a mindset you cultivate every day.”

  • Motivational Text:  
  – Definition: Calls to action that push toward growth or change a piece of writing, usually concise, that is designed to inspire, uplift, or encourage an individual to pursue goals or overcome obstacles. These texts can take various forms, including quotes, stories, speeches, and even articles or letters. The core function of motivational text is to evoke a positive mindset, instill confidence, and drive action. .  
  – Example: “Stop waiting for the perfect moment; create it with your own two hands.”

  • Quote Text:  
  – Definition: Motivational quotes are concise, Short, standalone sentences, aphorisms, inspiring phrases designed to encourage and uplift individuals, often helping them stay focused, determined, and positive.  
  – Example: “Fall seven times, stand up eight.”

  • Personal Growth Text:  
  – Definition: Insights into self-development, mindset shifts or Personal growth, also known as self-development, is a continuous process of improving oneself in various aspects of life, including mental, emotional, social, and physical well-being.  
  – Example: “Your only competition is the person you were yesterday.”
  ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
  Helper definitions (WHAT TO AVOID):
  • Avoid vague compliments or praise (e.g., “That was great!”)  
  • Avoid cliché or overused phrases with no fresh angle  
  • Avoid long-winded storytelling—opt for concise impact  
  • Avoid context-less lyrics, jokes, or tangents  
  • Avoid purely descriptive narration (e.g., “Today we talked about gratitude…”)
  • Avoid generic motivational fluff that sounds good but adds no new insight  
  • Avoid surface-level pep-talks lacking depth or practical advice  
  • Avoid motivational filler that pads out time without delivering a punch  
  • Avoid text that lacks enough context or “power lines”—snippets that sound strong but don’t stand on their own
  ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
  Helper definitions (Content to Exclude)
  • Avoid uncertain or hedged language (e.g., “I think this might help you…”).
      Why: You want bold statements, not wishy-washy suggestions.

  • Avoid questions or rhetorical setups (e.g., “Have you ever felt stuck?”).
      Why: Clips that ask questions leave viewers hanging—they need resolution or insight.

  • Avoid internal monologue or 2nd-person reflection (e.g., “I was thinking to myself…”).
      Why: We need universal truth or advice, not personal journaling.

  • Avoid overly technical or niche jargon (e.g., “Using an autoencoder to reconstruct latent features…”).
      Why: Keeps it accessible and broadly relatable.

  • Avoid excessive qualifiers or filler words (e.g., “Basically,” “Honestly,” “You know…”).
      Why: Cuts to the core message.

  • Avoid monotone observations (e.g., “This is what happened next.”).
      Why: We want emotional hooks, not neutral narration.

  •  Avoid back-pedaling or negations (e.g., “Don’t think this is too hard.”).
      Why: Positive, proactive language lands stronger.

  • Avoid over-explaining the obvious (e.g., “We all know that hard work leads to success.”).
      Why: Seeks fresh angles, not restated clichés.

  •  Avoid multi-step instructions (e.g., “First do this, then do that…”).
      Why: Short videos need one clear takeaway, not a how-to tutorial.

  •  Avoid embedded jokes or humorous asides (e.g., “I almost died laughing…”).
      Why: Humor can derail the motivational momentum unless it’s directly tied to the insight.
  ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––----------------------------------------

  Important considerations:
  • Each saved snippet must be **self-contained**: if watched alone, the viewer still “gets it.”  
  • Prioritize **novel insights**—phrases they’ll remember and possibly share.  
  • Ensure each snippet works as a **standalone motivational short**: concise, punchy, and immediately impactful.
  ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––------------------------------------------------------

  Now analyze the chunk below and extract any qualifying snippets based on the criteria above.  
  If there are none, reply clearly with: “No qualifying snippets found.” in the `final_answer` tool
  ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––------------------------------------------------------

  Very important: if you decide to save: If you merged any text, you must include it in a single SaveMotivationalText tool call along with all the timestamps. Each quote should normally have its own SaveMotivationalText tool call. However, if you've merged lines, include the merged lines with their exact timestamps inside one SaveMotivationalText call.

  
  Here are a few examples using notional tools:

  Above example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:
  {%- for tool in tools.values() %}
  - {{ tool.name }}: {{ tool.description }}
      Takes inputs: {{tool.inputs}}
      Returns an output of type: {{tool.output_type}}
  {%- endfor %}

  {%- if managed_agents and managed_agents.values() | list %}
  You can also give tasks to team members.
  Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.
  Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.
  Here is a list of the team members that you can call:
  {%- for agent in managed_agents.values() %}
  - {{ agent.name }}: {{ agent.description }}
  {%- endfor %}
  {%- else %}
  {%- endif %}

  Here are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:
  1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.
  2. Use only variables that you have defined!
  3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': "What is the place where James Bond lives?"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")'.
  4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.
  5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.
  6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.
  7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.
  9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.
  10. Don’t give up! You are responsible for solving the task and analyzing the chunk. Do not provide directions on how to solve it—you must analyze the chunk internally and execute `SaveMotivationalText` tool for the text that would be perfect for a standalone motivational short of 10-20 seconds  and final_answer as required. if you decide that nothing of the text in chunk provide a complete thought and should be saved only provide `final_answer` tool stating that.  
  11. Think carefully and reflect on your analysis. Use clear chain-of-thought reasoning to fully understand the context when analyzing text or chunks.  
  12. You MUST NOT add code logic like if-statements, loops, filters, or manual extraction methods. Use only the provided tools (e.g., SaveMotivationalText, final_answer) to save quotes. No quote processing or filtering outside these tools is allowed.
  13. Do not forget to include the connected exact timestamp + text  from the chunk  when you are executing the `SaveMotivationalText` tool!
  14. Remember this else you will FAIL:  you only need to provide one 'Thought: ' sequence 
  15. Remember this else you will FAIL:  you only need to provide one 'Code: ' sequence after 'Thought: ' sequence
  16. if Merged lines became a complete standalone thought worth saving, you must be saved with 1 `SaveMotivationalText` tool call and you must also include all the timestamps + text.  
  17. 1 `SaveMotivationalText` tool call per powerful messages. so if multiple lines was merged to provide a complete thought. you have too save all those lines + connected timestamp in 1 tool call
  18. when analyzing or saving you must include the exact timestamp.
  19. Remember. Do not save any incomplete thoughts or text that if isolated would not provide complete context on it's own.
  20. DO NO rewrite the chunk in the 'Thought: ' sequences
  21. Remember to always include the exact timestamp for the text lines you are  saving, if any lines was merged you must provide all timestamps and texts in the `SaveMotivationalText` tool
  22. Always preserve the original punctuation and formatting of the text lines when saving.— This avoids unintended meaning changes or loss of emphasis.
  23. Always confirm that the timestamps for saved text cover the full span of the merged lines exactly as in the chunk, without overlaps or gaps.
  24. YOU must understand what text you are looking for below is Exsample to help you with what to look for when analyzing chunk: 
    Here is a description/examples of text to show you what you are looking for:
    ✅ GOOD EXAMPLES (longer, richer motivational quotes):
      [1122.03s - 1130.60s] Believe in yourself even when no one else does; your inner strength will carry you through the toughest battles.
      [1132.00s - 1140.20s] Your only limit is the one you set yourself—break free from doubts and reach beyond what you thought possible.
      [1142.10s - 1150.55s] Success is not a straight line; it is forged by relentless effort, learning from failures, and never giving up on your dreams.

      [1207.50s - 1215.10s] Small progress each day leads to big results over time—consistency beats perfection every single time.
      [1217.00s - 1224.70s] Don’t wait for opportunity to knock; create your own doors and step boldly into your future.
      [1226.25s - 1233.90s] Your mindset shapes your reality—think like a winner, act like a champion, and success will follow.
      [1235.50s - 1243.20s] Great things never come from comfort zones; if you want extraordinary, you must be willing to take extraordinary risks.

      [1263.30s - 1270.95s] You are stronger than your strongest excuse; stop doubting and start doing.
      [1272.50s - 1279.95s] Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard; effort is your greatest advantage.
      [1281.20s - 1288.80s] Success is the sum of small efforts repeated daily; habits create your future.
      [1290.10s - 1297.65s] Let your passion fuel your progress, and your determination will turn dreams into reality.
      [1299.00s - 1306.50s] You don’t have to be perfect to start, but you have to start to be perfect—take that first step today.
      [1308.10s - 1315.60s] Rise every time you fall, stronger than before, because resilience is the true mark of a champion.

    ❌ BAD EXAMPLES (with explanations why to reject):
      Example                                        | Why reject
      ----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------
      [1317.00s - 1322.00s] And that's why you should never give up  
                                                    | Starts with "And" → incomplete, depends on prior context
      [1323.00s - 1327.50s] But if you think about it...  
                                                    | Starts with "But" → not a standalone message, dangling thought
      [1328.00s - 1332.00s] This is important because  
                                                    | Ends abruptly → incomplete thought, no conclusion
      [1333.00s - 1338.50s] I realized that sometimes we need to try  
                                                    | Starts with "I realized" → too personal, vague without context
      [1339.00s - 1344.00s] Because you never know what will happen  
                                                    | Starts with "Because" → dependent clause, no standalone meaning
      [1345.00s - 1349.50s] And then I said, "Go for it!"  
                                                    | Conversational fragment, makes no sense alone
      [1350.00s - 1354.50s] Which is why success is hard  
                                                    | Starts with "Which is why" → dependent clause, lacks context
      [1355.00s - 1360.00s] If only you could see what I see  
                                                    | Hypothetical, needs extra context, confusing alone
      [1361.00s - 1365.50s] Sometimes things just don’t work out  
                                                    | Too vague, lacks motivational direction or advice
      [1366.00s - 1370.00s] Because when you fail, you learn  
                                                    | Starts with "Because," incomplete, dependent clause
      [1371.00s - 1375.50s] I always try to be better  
                                                    | Too personal, lacks general motivational power
      [1376.00s - 1380.00s] So, what do you think about that?  
                                                    | Question directed at listener, requires context
      [1381.00s - 1385.00s] And now, the real work begins  
                                                    | Starts with "And" → dependent, incomplete
      [1594.20s - 1594.90s] We all do. [1597.66s - 1598.44s] That's what he's saying.
                                                    | Incomplete, lack context!

    Below I will present you a task.
    You will now build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need.
    To do so, you will have to read the task and identify things that must be discovered in order to successfully complete it.
    Don't make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Here is how you will structure this survey:

    ---
    ### 1. Facts given in the task
    List here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).

    ### 2. Facts to look up
    List here any facts that we may need to look up.
    Also list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.

    ### 3. Facts to derive
    List here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.

    Keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings:
    ### 1. Facts given in the task
    ### 2. Facts to look up
    ### 3. Facts to derive
    Do not add anything else.
  "initial_plan": |-
    You are a world expert at making efficient plans to solve any task using a set of carefully crafted tools.
    Now for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.
    This plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.
    Do not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.
    After writing the final step of the plan, write the '\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.

    Here is your task:

    Task:
    ```
    {{task}}
    ```
    You can leverage these tools:
    {%- for tool in tools.values() %}
    - {{ tool.name }}: {{ tool.description }}
        Takes inputs: {{tool.inputs}}
        Returns an output of type: {{tool.output_type}}
    {%- endfor %}

    {%- if managed_agents and managed_agents.values() | list %}
    You can also give tasks to team members.
    Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'request', a long string explaining your request.
    Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your request.
    Here is a list of the team members that you can call:
    {%- for agent in managed_agents.values() %}
    - {{ agent.name }}: {{ agent.description }}
    {%- endfor %}
    {%- else %}
    {%- endif %}

    List of facts that you know:
    ```
    {{answer_facts | default("") }}
    ```

    Now begin! Write your plan below.
  "update_facts_pre_messages": |-
    You are a world expert at gathering known and unknown facts based on a conversation.
    Below you will find a task, and a history of attempts made to solve the task. You will have to produce a list of these:
    ### 1. Facts given in the task
    ### 2. Facts that we have learned
    ### 3. Facts still to look up
    ### 4. Facts still to derive
    Find the task and history below:
  "update_facts_post_messages": |-
    Earlier we've built a list of facts.
    But since in your previous steps you may have learned useful new facts or invalidated some false ones.
    Please update your list of facts based on the previous history, and provide these headings:
    ### 1. Facts given in the task
    ### 2. Facts that we have learned
    ### 3. Facts still to look up
    ### 4. Facts still to derive
    Now write your new list of facts below.
  "update_plan_pre_messages": |-
    You are a world expert at making efficient plans to solve any task using a set of carefully crafted tools.
    You have been given a task:
    ```
    {{task}}
    ```

    Find below the record of what has been tried so far to solve it. Then you will be asked to make an updated plan to solve the task.
    If the previous tries so far have met some success, you can make an updated plan based on these actions.
    If you are stalled, you can make a completely new plan starting from scratch.
  "update_plan_post_messages": |-
    You're still working towards solving this task:
    ```
    {{task}}
    ```
    You can leverage these tools:
    {%- for tool in tools.values() %}
    - {{ tool.name }}: {{ tool.description }}
        Takes inputs: {{tool.inputs}}
        Returns an output of type: {{tool.output_type}}
    {%- endfor %}

    {%- if managed_agents and managed_agents.values() | list %}
    You can also give tasks to team members.
    Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task'.
    Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task, it should be a long string providing informations as detailed as necessary.
    Here is a list of the team members that you can call:
    {%- for agent in managed_agents.values() %}
    - {{ agent.name }}: {{ agent.description }}
    {%- endfor %}
    {%- else %}
    {%- endif %}

    Here is the up to date list of facts that you know:
    ```
    {{facts_update}}
    ```

    Now for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.
    This plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.
    Beware that you have {remaining_steps} steps remaining.
    Do not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.
    After writing the final step of the plan, write the '\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.

    Now write your new plan below.
"managed_agent":
  "task": |-
    You're a helpful agent named '{{name}}'.
    You have been submitted this task by your manager.
    ---
    Task:
    {{task}}
    ---
    You're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.
    Your final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:
    ### 1. Task outcome (short version):
    ### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):
    ### 3. Additional context (if relevant):

    Put all these in your final_answer tool, everything that you do not pass as an argument to final_answer will be lost.
    And even if your task resolution is not successful, please return as much context as possible, so that your manager can act upon this feedback.
  "report": |-
    Here is the final answer from your managed agent '{{name}}':
    {{final_answer}}
"final_answer":
  pre_messages: |-
    An agent tried to answer a user query but it got stuck and failed to do so. You are tasked with providing an answer instead. Here is the agent's memory:
  post_messages: |-
    Based on the above, please provide an answer to the following user task:
    {{task}}
