{"prompt":"You are an expert at identifying powerful, share-worthy snippets from motivational podcast transcripts.\\\nYour job is to:\\\n1. Read the transcript chunk below and internally reason through its overall message.\\\n2. Understand the connection between the lines. and what they are saying. This will happend internally and not in 'Thought: ' sequence.\\\nRemember do not save any text that does not provide a complete thought. the goal is that this text will be used as a motivational shorts video. before you save the text you identified, ask yourself if you were a listener, would you understand it.\\\n2. Extract only those lines or passages that:\\\n• Stand alone with full context (no missing setup).  \\\n• Pack a punch of advice, insight, or inspiration.  \\\n• Are memorable enough to anchor a motivational short video.\\\n• Are complete thoughts or sentences, that if the text you decide to save were isolated from the rest would provide a complete thought and understanding for the listener.\\\n• A complete thought is that the overall meaning of the setence\\ntext does not miss any context like exsample of lacking context is that it starts with (and, but, etc).\\\n\\\nDo NOT save generic fluff—the transcript as text in chunk is already motivational.\\\nthe text you choose too save needs to be complete and would result in a max  10-20 seconds motivational shorts video \\\nIF you no text is identified. nothing that could be a standalone moitvational short, only provide `final_answer` tool stating that, this will also successfully achieve the task.\\\n\\\nIn the 'Thought: ' sequence. write a short summary describing the overall context of the chunk and then explain shortly what text you are looking for to save in order to fufill the task then procceed in 'Code: ' sequence  with the text to save after you internally have analyzed it all.\\\n\\\nYou must have analyzed, Focus on logical flow, completeness, and independence like a human reader on the text in chunk before any saving. and then save all identified text if any is present else provide only `final_answer`\\\n\\\nHere is the chunk\\ntext you will analyze:\\\n\\\n[chunk start]\\\n[2025.30s - 2030.55s] I know some days it feels like nothing’s moving forward. Like you’re stuck in a loop of frustration and doubt.  \\\n[2030.56s - 2036.10s] But progress isn’t always loud or flashy. Sometimes it’s quiet, almost invisible.  \\\n[2036.10s - 2042.77s] It’s the small steps you take when no one’s watching. The discipline to keep going when motivation fades.  \\\n[2042.78s - 2049.34s] “Success is often found in the moments when you choose persistence over comfort.”  \\\n[2049.35s - 2055.22s] That one thought changed how I approach my goals—it’s a reminder that what matters most is the effort you put in consistently.  \\\n[2055.23s - 2061.90s] So even if today feels like a failure, or a pause, it’s actually part of the process. You’re building something strong underneath.
