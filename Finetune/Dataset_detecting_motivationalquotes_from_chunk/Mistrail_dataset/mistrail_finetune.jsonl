So whether you're listening to this episode\n        [16.15s - 21.83s] because you struggle right now with overthinking or feeling unworthy, or maybe you have a really\n        [21.83s - 27.51s] positive outlook, but you just want to level up. You want to play a bigger game. That's where I am\n        [27.51s - 33.71s] right now.

Okay. I wanted to just start today by saying thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you\n        [53.07s - 61.29s] to you. I often say that the Mel Robbins podcast is not my podcast. It's our podcast because this is a\n        [61.29s - 65.17s] conversation between you and me. And I wanted to start off by saying thank you because\n        [65.17s - 76.25s] about 90 seconds ago, I got word that you have voted the Mel Robbins podcast as the most inspirational\n        [76.25s - 85.07s] podcast of 2022.

I wanted to thank you for showing up, for listening,\n        [98.95s - 104.67s] for sharing these episodes with friends and family members, for giving us feedback, for asking questions,\n        [104.67s - 112.57s] for submitting topic ideas.

And I'm going to explain what a mindset reset is. The simple step\n    [290.84s - 295.80s] the simple steps to doing it, it's all going to make sense in a couple minutes. But I want to give\n    [295.80s - 302.92s] you a preview so that as we step into the process of giving yourself a reset mentally, that you have\n    [302.92s - 308.76s] a baseline understanding. So here's a preview of what we're going to talk about, okay? You have a filter\n    [308.76s - 315.62s] in your brain, and I'm going to teach you using science and neuroscience, how to use this filter\n    [315.62s - 320.74s] that's already in your brain to your advantage. And everything that I'm going to teach you,\n    [320.84s - 325.78s] you can put to practice immediately. And what I love so much about this conversation that we're\n    [325.78s - 333.04s] about to have is that you may even experience an immediate change the first time you try this\n    [333.04s - 338.68s] little thing I'm going to teach you. This is so cool because the moment you experience this small\n    [338.68s - 344.68s] change in your mindset, it will create momentum. It creates excitement. It creates possibility.\n    [344.98s - 351.36s] There's this opening of a whole new way of thinking. But before we can get there, I want to just start\n    [351.36s - 357.80s] with the basics so that you feel really empowered around the topic of mindset and around reprogramming\n    [357.80s - 362.72s] this filter in your brain. So let's just start with a definition. So we're all using the same\n    [362.72s - 371.06s] terminology. And let's define you and I. What is a mindset? Well, your mindset is your beliefs and your\n    [371.06s - 377.18s] opinions about the way that the world works. That's the definition when you look it up. However, you know\n    [377.18s - 382.22s] that I prefer metaphors. Mel Robbins is dyslexic, so she likes to be able to visualize something,\n    [382.40s - 388.80s] especially when we're talking about this intellectual stuff, okay? So the metaphor that I love when it\n    [388.80s - 395.16s] comes to mindset and the science-y, psychological, neurological aspect of mindset and brain programming\n    [395.16s - 404.91s] is I use the metaphor sunglasses. I think about your mindset like a pair of sunglasses. So stop and\n    [404.91s - 411.17s] think right now about your favorite pair of sunglasses. I have these sunglasses that I have had for almost\n    [411.17s - 415.83s] 15 years. I bought them because we were going on this rafting trip and I had forgot to pack my\n    [415.83s - 422.23s] sunglasses. And so I bought the only cool pair of sunglasses that they had on that turnstile thing\n    [422.23s - 428.33s] on the counter. They were like 15 bucks and they were these huge black bug-eyed glasses. I feel like\n    [428.33s - 434.37s] Jackie O when I wear them. So think about your favorite pair of sunglasses for just a minute. Now I want you\n    [434.37s - 441.60s] to think about the lens color and think about how when you put on that pair of sunglasses, that lens on\n    [441.60s - 448.82s] your favorite sunglasses, it colors and filters what you see and it gives it a tint, right? I mean,\n    [448.84s - 454.88s] if you put on rose-colored sunglasses, the world has a rosy bright tint to it. If you put on amber\n    [454.88s - 460.84s] sunglasses, same thing. Gray, same thing. My big black bug-eyed glasses that I just love. I feel so glamorous\n    [460.84s - 469.58s] in these $15 plastic things. Everything looks crazy dark. Just really blocks everything out. Your mindset\n    [469.58s - 475.25s] works the same way as a pair of sunglasses. Let's go back to the written definition of your mindset.\n    [475.39s - 481.31s] Your mindset is made up of your beliefs and your opinions. And just like the lens on a pair of\n    [481.31s - 488.09s] sunglasses, those beliefs and opinions that you have, they create a mindset through which you filter\n    [488.09s - 494.67s] the world. And I'm going to give you a couple examples. Let's say you're a pessimistic person.\n    [494.67s - 500.80s] If that's your mindset, if that's your outlook, you will filter the world through pessimism.\n    [501.24s - 506.34s] Just like a dark pair of sunglasses skews the outside world with this black and darker shade.\n    [507.21s - 513.25s] And if you're not pessimistic, let's just think about the most pessimistic person you know.\n    [514.06s - 521.20s] Someone who is always negative. They could be sitting on the beach in the Bahamas with a beautiful,\n    [521.20s - 528.46s] fabulous, tropical drink in their hands. Sun is shining, crystal clear ocean, and they're annoyed\n    [528.46s - 534.46s] because lunch hasn't come out yet. You know that kind of person. You've sat next to them at a wedding\n    [534.46s - 540.90s] where the band is awesome. The couple is so cute and happy. Family's together. And what is this person\n    [540.90s - 546.22s] doing? They're bitching about something. Some relative that's sitting all the way on the other [chunkend]\\\n", "completion": "Thought:  The overall context of the chunk is a motivational podcast episode discussing the importance of mindset and how to control it.

I want you to think about someone you work with, or maybe you go to school\n        [600.78s - 607.68s] person who has a can-do attitude. No matter how tight the deadline or how rude the customer is that you\n        [607.68s - 613.14s] guys are waiting on, or how much other team members are slacking off, this one person with a can-do\n        [613.14s - 620.90s] attitude, they always see the bright side. Or they have this unbelievable ability to just shrug off\n        [620.90s - 626.18s] the rudeness of other people or the laziness of the students that are on your group project.\n        [626.18s - 631.10s] And they literally can just flip it and turn to you and go, well, you know, they probably have\n        [631.10s - 638.90s] something going on in their personal life. It's as if they always see any situation or any relationship\n        [638.90s - 644.14s] from the positive. They see possibility. They give people the benefit of the doubt. They assume good\n        [644.14s - 653.60s] intent. This too is a mindset. It's just like putting on a rosy pair of sunglasses. Everything is\n        [653.60s - 659.32s] sharper, clearer, brighter when you have this kind of mindset. Even a cloudy, crappy day looks like a\n        [659.32s - 664.86s] beautiful sunrise. In fact, there's a really cool study from the University of Toronto about rose-colored\n        [664.86s - 672.36s] glasses. This isn't just a saying. When you wear rose-colored glasses, your attitude is better. And\n        [672.36s - 679.52s] there's even more based on this research. When you wear rose-colored glasses, you even see more. Your visual\n        [679.52s - 687.02s] horizon is expanded because these rose-colored glasses put you in a good mood. Your mindset determines the\n        [687.02s - 693.57s] way you view the world. And that determines how you think. So I want to do a gut check right now with\n        [693.57s - 701.82s] you. If you had to tell the truth, or actually, let's make this really accurate. If your best friend\n        [701.82s - 710.72s] had to describe the color of the sunglasses that you wear, would they say that you're more on the lane\n        [710.72s - 720.84s] of the dark, bug-eyed, plastic glasses that just skewed everything like it was midnight? Or are you more\n        [720.84s - 727.64s] on the range of everything's rosy? You're always positive. You are always upbeat. You see beauty\n        [727.64s - 735.90s] where most people see nothing. Do a quick gut check with yourself because your mindset is critical. It shapes\n        [735.90s - 742.82s] the way you view the world. And that determines how and what you think about. It also determines how you feel\n        [742.82s - 749.52s] about the present moment, about your past, and about the future. And most importantly, this is where it gets\n        [749.52s - 758.70s] really important. Your mindset determines what actions you take and what actions you don't take. And it also impacts\n        [758.70s - 769.62s] how you see other people. So for example, if I asked you, so what's your mom like? Before you even answer the\n        [769.62s - 779.57s] question, you subconsciously drop on sunglasses, and it filters your opinion about her. And by having a filter about\n        [779.57s - 786.95s] another person, it also limits what's possible for her. You think she just is that way, which means there's\n        [786.95s - 795.31s] no room for her to change. So why is mindset and getting intentional about changing your mindset? Why is\n        [795.31s - 801.35s] this so important? Why do you need to know what color the lens is that you view the world through? And more\n        [801.35s - 808.47s] importantly, why it's time to pop those lenses out if they don't serve you and put in different lenses so\n        [808.47s - 815.47s] that you can see things differently. I'll tell you why your mindset is so important. Because so much of\n        [815.47s - 823.00s] your potential is either limited or expanded by your mindset. I proved to you almost every single episode\n        [823.00s - 830.04s] on the Mel Robbins podcast, that with the right attitude and consistent action, you can absolutely change [chunkend]\\\n", "completion": "Thought:  This chunk explains how a positive mindset shapes the way you see challenges, people, and opportunities, ultimately influencing your actions and overall life experience.

Because your mindset is not\n        [866.23s - 872.80s] inspiring you to do anything about it. Being able to spot those dark lenses, pop them out, put in\n        [872.80s - 880.32s] something brighter, rosier, more luminous, it's going to change everything. And here's why. When you feel\n        [880.32s - 887.62s] more hopeful, or when you see options, and you start to tell yourself, well, why not? Why don't I just\n        [887.62s - 893.38s] try it?

For example, you and I cannot change that there is discrimination in this world.\n        [1039.52s - 1046.82s] There is bias and there is violence that a lot of people experience. We cannot change the fact\n        [1046.82s - 1053.32s] that poverty and mental health issues impact people for real. But here's what you can do.\n        [1054.01s - 1061.89s] You can train yourself to look at the future and decide how you're going to react to and respond to\n        [1061.89s - 1068.31s] the things that you're facing in your life. You can decide how you're going to heal and what you're\n        [1068.31s - 1074.01s] going to do about those things for yourself and your community. And one final thing.

And I'm going to tell you something. A positive mindset is not going to change\n[1100.07s - 1105.59s] the reality of what is going on around you. Here's what it does. And this is why it's important.\n[1106.32s - 1115.75s] It empowers you to face it, to deal with it, and to survive it.

So let's just say\n[1140.96s - 1151.91s] that you are in a job and you hate it. You feel stuck. You feel like you're kind of dead inside.\n[1151.91s - 1158.79s] You're not excited about anything. It's day in, day out, the same thing. Or if you're not working\n[1158.79s - 1164.71s] right now and let's say you've taken time off to raise your kids and you're sitting there going,\n[1164.81s - 1169.23s] I want to get back in the workforce, but I don't have any skills and I've got a 20-year hold in my\n[1169.23s - 1177.33s] resume. If your mindset is like those dark bug-eyed sunglasses that just muddy everything that you see,\n[1177.33s - 1182.33s] this is what you're telling yourself. Nobody's going to hire me. I don't have any experience.\n[1182.81s - 1187.35s] I don't even know how to write a resume. How the hell am I going to get into interior design when I went to\n[1187.35s - 1191.89s] college for accounting and I work in a big accounting firm and I don't even know how to begin doing this.\n[1191.93s - 1198.14s] I can't make this happen. If that is the way that you look at the future, if that's your mindset,\n[1198.14s - 1204.74s] if you color what's possible through that dark lens, if you keep telling yourself those things,\n[1205.10s - 1212.16s] you will see a world where you can't change. So are you going to feel inspired to work on your\n[1212.16s - 1219.56s] resume? Of course not. Are you going to feel empowered to start Googling and researching and\n[1219.56s - 1227.04s] figuring out how to go from an accounting job into interior design? No. Because your mindset\n[1227.04s - 1233.04s] has stopped you before you even started. And that's why it's critical for you to realize this\n[1233.04s - 1237.46s] is not just a conversation about your thoughts.

I got to get you to have the kind of mindset that also says,\n[1248.14s - 1253.28s] hey, it's worth it. Hey, I can do something about this. Because if I can get you to be more optimistic,\n[1253.28s - 1258.12s] if I can get you to take the dark lens off and put on a lighter one, if I can get you to start\n[1258.12s - 1263.38s] believing, it is worth it for you to apply.

Never even noticed them before. Or you hear a song and you tune in, you're like,\n[1616.48s - 1620.64s] oh, I love that song. That song is so cool. And suddenly you hear the song playing in every restaurant.\n[1621.42s - 1626.78s] Maybe you haven't shopped for a car, but I bet when you were looking at colleges, it's like,\n[1626.78s - 1634.12s] wait a minute. Does everybody have a Michigan sweatshirt? Does everybody's parents go there?\n[1634.48s - 1640.84s] Is there a sticker that says University of Michigan on every car? Is it just me? Or is that the only\n[1640.84s - 1647.10s] college in town? It's the same thing if you want to have a baby. As soon as you are trying to get\n[1647.10s - 1651.64s] pregnant, you know what happens? You see kids and pregnant women everywhere. It's like there were only\n[1651.64s - 1656.60s] adults on the planet and people that weren't pregnant, and then you want a baby and boom, it's in\n[1656.60s - 1662.90s] your face. Or how about this one? You want to fall in love. What do you see? You see couples in love.\n[1663.14s - 1670.70s] It's so annoying. It happens instantaneously. You know what that is? That phenomenon where all of a sudden\n[1670.70s - 1681.96s] overnight you see something everywhere. That is your mind changing in real time. That is a filter in\n[1681.96s - 1691.38s] your brain paying attention to what it thinks you are excited about or interested in, and it's changing\n[1691.38s - 1697.94s] what it's showing you in the world around you. And here's the crazy thing about your mind, and this is\n[1697.94s - 1706.41s] why this science is so exciting when you understand it. Oh my God. Here's the crazy part. You ready?\n[1706.41s - 1716.97s] The Broncos, the Bangs, the Birkenstocks, the Babies. They were always there all around you. You just\n[1716.97s - 1723.40s] didn't notice them. You want to know why? Because they were not important to you. The fact that you\n[1723.40s - 1733.50s] suddenly see those things everywhere, that is an example, and it is proof that your brain wiring is\n[1733.50s - 1742.71s] changing in real time. And your mind is trying to help you. Your mind is showing you the Broncos that\n[1742.71s - 1747.57s] have always been there. It's like it's highlighting it with a highlighter. Why? Because it became\n[1747.57s - 1753.81s] important to you. Why would your mind let you see things sometimes, but not others? Why are you\n[1753.81s - 1758.37s] suddenly seeing the covered toe Birkenstocks now, but you didn't see them for the last five years?\n[1758.37s - 1766.06s] That's a great question. And this brings us to the topic of the filter in your mind. Oh, I'm so\n[1766.06s - 1773.14s] excited for you to learn this. So there is a filter in your mind. It is called the reticular activating\n[1773.14s - 1781.96s] system. The reticular activating system. I'm going to call this the RAS, okay? Here's the visual,\n[1782.08s - 1788.28s] because you know your friend Mel loves visuals and metaphors to make this stuff easy. I want you to\n[1788.28s - 1798.22s] imagine that there is a hairnet over your brain. This hairnet is a live network of neurons and it is\n[1798.22s - 1808.76s] constantly changing in real time. And this RAS, this network of neuron hairnet that sits over your brain\n[1808.76s - 1817.16s] as a filter, it has one job, a very important job, mind you. The RAS has to determine in real time,\n[1817.16s - 1824.28s] I'm talking nanoseconds. What information it should allow into your conscious mind for you to see and\n[1824.28s - 1831.00s] register and what information it will block out from your conscious mind. Another way that you can\n[1831.00s - 1836.97s] think about the RAS is think about it like a bouncer in your brain. And the reason why you need a bouncer\n[1836.97s - 1845.81s] is because life is sort of like a very popular nightclub. Everybody wants to get in. And because there's so\n[1845.81s - 1852.57s] much and so many people and so many things showing up at a very popular nightclub trying to jam their way\n[1852.57s - 1860.65s] in the door, you need a bouncer who is deciding who gets in and who has to stand in that long line\n[1860.65s - 1867.49s] freezing their ass off in an outfit that is not appropriate for winter trying to get in, okay?\n[1867.49s - 1875.65s] So let's go back to the example of the car and the purses and the babies and the University of Michigan\n[1875.65s - 1883.55s] stickers that you suddenly see everywhere. The truth is all that stuff, all the cars on the road, all the handbags\n[1883.55s - 1891.49s] people have, the hairstyles, it was already there. It was already in your subconscious. You quote, saw it,\n[1891.49s - 1898.81s] but the RAS didn't allow you to register it. It shoved it right in that line. It did not let it\n[1898.81s - 1906.54s] into your conscious mind. The RAS is the bouncer. It determines what is it that is important enough [chunk end] \\\n ", "completion": "Thought: This chunk’s overall message centers some motivational thoughts but  does not contain any complete powerful standalone sentences or quotes that convey a full motivational insight by themselves and suitable for a motivational shorts video (10-20) seconds .

Holy shit, there's\n[1912.88s - 1916.80s] another Bronco. I'm not getting the blue gray color now because that's like the third one I've seen\n[1916.80s - 1920.78s] today. In fact, I don't even know that if I want a Bronco anymore. And I don't think I want bangs\n[1920.78s - 1926.58s] anymore either because it looks like every single person that I meet has bangs. This is how the\n[1926.58s - 1933.52s] bouncer in your mind works. It literally has a guest list and you're the one that writes the guest list\n[1933.52s - 1940.88s] out. What is on the guest list of your mind? Anything that is important to you, okay? All the other\n[1940.88s - 1946.34s] yahoos that are not on the list, all the other colleges that are on stickers, on every other car,\n[1946.34s - 1952.44s] Dartmouth, Harvard, Brown, University of Wittenberg, not even noticing those. Why? Because\n[1952.44s - 1957.00s] you're thinking about University of Michigan. So all those other college stickers, they're waiting in\n[1957.00s - 1960.96s] line. They're not getting in. That bouncer won't let them in. But boom, there's a University of\n[1960.96s - 1967.86s] Michigan, short skirt. Come on, you're going in. That's how it works. And so this is super, super\n[1967.86s - 1973.90s] important and it's really exciting, okay? It's really exciting because when you understand that\n[1973.90s - 1979.86s] there's this electric hairnet on your brain called the RAS that works like a bouncer at a popular\n[1979.86s - 1988.90s] nightclub, we can tell that bouncer what you want, who you want to let in. It's that simple.\n[1989.26s - 1995.08s] And there's another important reason for the RAS and why you need a bouncer, okay? And the reason is\n[1995.08s - 2002.38s] information overload. It's just impossible for the human brain to consciously process all the data\n[2002.38s - 2008.84s] that is literally, that is coming in through all five senses.

So now I\n        [2320.11s - 2327.13s] want to go a layer deeper and I want to start to apply this flexibility in your filter to changing\n        [2327.13s - 2332.87s] your mindset. So let's start with this question from a listener named Peter. Hey, this is Peter from\n        [2332.87s - 2338.43s] Washington. I was just wondering, how do I get past my doubts and maintain a positive mindset?\n        [2338.85s - 2344.21s] Thanks, Mel. Thanks, Peter. So I want to focus on one aspect of your question, and that is where you\n        [2344.21s - 2350.73s] said getting past your doubts. This is where the science gets really interesting because your belief\n        [2350.73s - 2359.26s] about yourself is a mindset. I'm going to say that again. Your belief about yourself filters how you\n        [2359.26s - 2365.24s] see the world. And I'm going to give you an example. You use the word, Peter, self-doubt. If you have a\n        [2365.24s - 2372.80s] lot of self-doubt, you question yourself, you criticize yourself, you hold yourself back, what color do you\n        [2372.80s - 2379.10s] think the lenses on your sunglasses are? I'm not trying to be silly here. I'm trying to make this\n        [2379.10s - 2390.41s] intellectual topic very tangible and understandable. If you have a lot of self-doubt, what is the color\n        [2390.41s - 2398.30s] of the lenses on the sunglasses? Because this is where the filter in your brain starts to become\n        [2398.30s - 2404.96s] programmed by your mindset. Now I said earlier that your filter focuses on showing you what it thinks\n        [2404.96s - 2411.50s] is important to you. How does it know what's important to you? I'll tell you. I said earlier\n        [2411.50s - 2419.40s] that the RAS, that filter, its sole job is showing you what it thinks is important to you. So it begs\n        [2419.40s - 2424.73s] the question, right, Peter? If you haven't been intentional, at least you didn't think you were,\n        [2425.55s - 2429.33s] about telling the filter what to show you, how the hell does it know what to show you?\n        [2429.33s - 2436.66s] Well, it shows you whatever you spend your time, energy, thoughts, and attention focused on.\n        [2437.56s - 2445.00s] So going back to your question about self-doubt, if you doubt yourself, right, you put a lot of energy\n        [2445.00s - 2453.38s] into doubting yourself. It's not just one thought. You probably do it all day long. Your thoughts are\n        [2453.38s - 2459.64s] critical, you hesitate, you don't speak up, you hold yourself back. All of that is energy\n        [2459.64s - 2467.03s] energy that makes your RAS think that doubting yourself is important.

So here's one more example about how your own beliefs and mindset about yourself\n        [2752.96s - 2761.41s] or a situation that you're in can become paralyzing because the filter in your brain keeps the mindset\n        [2761.41s - 2771.04s] in place, okay? So think about somebody that you love who's single and they are desperate to meet\n        [2771.04s - 2778.64s] the right person.

I'll never find\n        [2816.90s - 2821.86s] somebody. Why does everybody else have somebody? I see all my friends getting approached at the bars.\n        [2822.00s - 2829.90s] I see my friends getting asked out. Why am I not getting asked out? What you've now learned about the\n        [2829.90s - 2836.70s] mindset and belief about yourself and the way your filter responds in real time is the more energy you\n        [2836.70s - 2841.46s] put into a negative narrative like this.

The more that mindset\n        [2847.42s - 2853.82s] and that belief becomes a self-fulfilling situation. Why? Because you're putting so much energy into the\n        [2853.82s - 2858.90s] negative that the filter in your brain is now going to filter the world in a way to reinforce the\n        [2858.90s - 2865.14s] negative story.\n        [2865.14s - 2870.49s] going to focus on all the other people that are single that you should walk up and talk to.
