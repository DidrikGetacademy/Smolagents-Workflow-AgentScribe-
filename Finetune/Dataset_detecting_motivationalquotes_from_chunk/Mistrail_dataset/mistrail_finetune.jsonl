And I see so many of you writing about your desire to\\\n[1088.17s - 1094.11s] create a better life and the fact that it's hard because you're living in Iran or your country is\\\n[1094.11s - 1100.07s] under siege like Ukraine. And I'm going to tell you something. A positive mindset is not going to change\\\n[1100.07s - 1105.59s] the reality of what is going on around you. Here's what it does. And this is why it's important.\\\n[1106.32s - 1115.75s] It empowers you to face it, to deal with it, and to survive it. That's what a mindset does.\\\n[1116.43s - 1122.03s] And that's why it's important to get serious about training your mind to work for you.\\\n[1122.03s - 1126.50s] “Courage doesn’t always roar; sometimes it’s the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, ‘I will try again tomorrow.’”\\\n[1126.51s - 1130.60s] And this connection between mindset and action, this is so important that I want to give you one more example…\\\n[1130.60s - 1140.96s] more example about how your mindset either inspires action or it discourages it. So let's just say\\\n[1140.96s - 1151.91s] that you are in a job and you hate it. You feel stuck. You feel like you're kind of dead inside.\\\n[1151.91s - 1158.79s] You're not excited about anything. It's day in, day out, the same thing. Or if you're not working\\\n[1158.79s - 1164.71s] right now and let's say you've taken time off to raise your kids and you're sitting there going,\\\n[1164.81s - 1169.23s] I want to get back in the workforce, but I don't have any skills and I've got a 20-year hold in my\\\n[1169.23s - 1177.33s] resume. If your mindset is like those dark bug-eyed sunglasses that just muddy everything that you see,\\\n[1177.33s - 1182.33s] this is what you're telling yourself. Nobody's going to hire me. I don't have any experience.\\\n[1182.81s - 1187.35s] I don't even know how to write a resume. How the hell am I going to get into interior design when I went to\\\n[1187.35s - 1191.89s] college for accounting and I work in a big accounting firm and I don't even know how to begin doing this.\\\n[1191.93s - 1198.14s] I can't make this happen. If that is the way that you look at the future, if that's your mindset,\\\n[1198.14s - 1204.74s] if you color what's possible through that dark lens, if you keep telling yourself those things,\\\n[1205.10s - 1212.16s] you will see a world where you can't change. So are you going to feel inspired to work on your\\\n[1212.16s - 1219.56s] resume? Of course not. Are you going to feel empowered to start Googling and researching and\\\n[1219.56s - 1227.04s] figuring out how to go from an accounting job into interior design? No. Because your mindset\\\n[1227.04s - 1233.04s] has stopped you before you even started. And that's why it's critical for you to realize this\\\n[1233.04s - 1237.46s] is not just a conversation about your thoughts. At the end of the day, if you don't have a positive\\\n[1237.46s - 1241.82s] mindset, you and I can talk about actions and habits all day long till we're blue in the face,\\\n[1242.00s - 1247.74s] but you won't do shit about it. I got to get you to have the kind of mindset that also says,\\\n[1248.14s - 1253.28s] hey, it's worth it. Hey, I can do something about this. Because if I can get you to be more optimistic,\\\n[1253.28s - 1258.12s] if I can get you to take the dark lens off and put on a lighter one, if I can get you to start\\\n[1258.12s - 1263.38s] believing, it is worth it for you to apply. It is worth it for you to put your dating app back up.\\\n[1263.70s - 1267.68s] Yeah, it is worth it for you to pick up the pen and start working on that book you've always wanted\\\n[1267.68s - 1272.50s] to write. Hell yes, it's worth it for you to take 10 minutes today and lay down on the floor and do\\\n[1272.50s - 1277.32s] those stretching exercises that the doctor told you should do because you threw your back out instead\\\n[1277.32s - 1282.38s] of sitting on the couch and bitching about it. Of course it's worth it. If I can get you to start to\\\n[1283.28s - 1288.93s] oh, easy for you to say, Mel. Works out for you. Doesn't work out for me. It's not going to help.\\\n[1289.01s - 1296.61s] I've had anxiety for years. If I can get you into, hey, maybe it will work. Hey, maybe I'm ready.\\\n[1297.57s - 1305.37s] Maybe I should try this. Maybe I do deserve this. That singular switch in your mindset motivates you,\\\n[1305.91s - 1313.97s] encourages you to take action. And that's critical. Because without action, your problems are not going\\\n[1313.97s - 1320.21s] away. Without action, those dreams are not coming true. Without action, you are not healing the crap\\\n[1320.21s - 1327.14s] that's giving you pain. When you change your mindset, it doesn't make those challenges disappear. It\\\n[1327.14s - 1332.74s] changes your ability to face them. And so I'm going to teach you and I'm going to teach Brandy.
