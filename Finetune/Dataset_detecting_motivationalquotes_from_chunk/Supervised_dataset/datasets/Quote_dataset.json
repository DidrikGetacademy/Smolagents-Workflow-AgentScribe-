I know how much you like to hear it, but I don't only write it because you like it. I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write you. It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you. Almost two years, but I know you'll excuse me because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic, and I thought there was no sense to writing. But now I know, my darling wife, that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, and that I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I will always love you. I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead. But I still want to comfort and take care of you. And I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you. I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until now that we can do that. What should we do? We started to learn to make clothes together, or learn Chinese, or get a movie projector. Can't I do something now? No. I am alone without you. And you were the idea woman, and general instigator of all our wild adventures. When you were sick, you worried, because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn't have worried, just as I told you then. There was no real need, because I loved you in so many ways, so much. And now, it is clearly even more true. You can give me nothing, yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else. But I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive. I know you will assure me that I am foolish, and that you want me to have full happiness, and don't want to be in my way. I'll bet you are surprised that I don't even have a girlfriend, except you, sweetheart, after two years. But you can't help it, darling. Nor can I. I don't understand it, for I have met many girls, and very nice ones, and I don't want to remain alone. But, in two or three meetings, they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real. My darling wife, I do adore you. I love my wife. My wife is dead.  "

Not everyone is replaceable. Some people come into your life and connect with your soul in a way that no one else ever will. And when you lose them, that space that they used to fill, it stays empty. You're going to look for them in other people. In smiles, in laughs, in hugs. And it just doesn't feel quite right. But they won't be there. Because that kind of connection, it was once in a lifetime. We hurt the people that are closest to us. Not always on purpose, but with neglect, with pride, with silence. And we assume. We assume that there'll be time to fix it.  "

        "quote": " You don't yell at your children. An emotionally regulated parent, a healthy parent, produces a healthy child. So what is a healthy parent? A healthy parent is a parent who feels good about themselves, who has authentically good self-esteem, not grandiosity, but really feels good about themselves, knows their strengths and limitations, and overall, as a whole person, feels good about themselves. They have the capacity to regulate their emotions, to keep their emotions from going too high and too low. Remember, sailing in the Caribbean, meaning they can stay calm in a storm, is sensitive and empathic as a nurturer. These are signs of health in a parent.  "

Why the hell did this happen? Makes no damn sense. Now I'm supposed to come back from this and be the same player or better at 35? How in the world am I supposed to do that? I have no clue. Do I have the consistent will to overcome this thing? Maybe I should break out of this rocking chair and reminisce on the career that was. Maybe this is how my book ends. Maybe far the time has defeated me. Then again, maybe not. It's 3.30am, my foot feels like a dead weight. My head is spinning from the pain meds and I'm wide awake. Forgive my venting, but what's the purpose of social media if I won't bring this to you? No real image. Feels good to vent, let it out, to feel as if this was the worst thing ever. Because after all the venting, the real perspective sets in. There are far greater issues and challenges in the world than a torn Achilles. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, find the silver lining and get to work with the same belief, same drive and same conviction as ever. One day, the beginning of a new career journey will commence. Today is not that day. If you see me in a fight with a bear, pray for the bear. That's Mamba mentality. We don't quit, we don't cower, we don't run, we endure and conquer.

Not be able to say this without crying, which is going to be very embarrassing, but I'm going to try. October 17th, 1946. D'Arlene, I adore you, sweetheart. I know how much you like to hear it, but I don't only write it because you like it. I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write you. It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you. Almost two years, but I know you'll excuse me because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic, and I thought there was no sense to writing. But now I know, my darling wife, that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, and that I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I will always love you. I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead. But I still want to comfort and take care of you. And I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you. I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until now that we can do that. What should we do? We started to learn to make clothes together, or learn Chinese, or get a movie projector. Can't I do something now? No. I am alone without you. And you were the idea woman, and general instigator of all our wild adventures. When you were sick, you worried, because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn't have worried, just as I told you then. There was no real need, because I loved you in so many ways, so much. And now, it is clearly even more true. You can give me nothing, yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else. But I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive. I know you will assure me that I am foolish, and that you want me to have full happiness, and don't want to be in my way. I'll bet you are surprised that I don't even have a girlfriend, except you, sweetheart, after two years. But you can't help it, darling. Nor can I. I don't understand it, for I have met many girls, and very nice ones, and I don't want to remain alone. But, in two or three meetings, they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real. My darling wife, I do adore you. I love my wife. My wife is dead.  "

Next, we could all use a little help in coaching, which means pray for wisdom so that you'll have the answers to people's questions this year that you didn't have last year. You'll be better equipped to give those answers next year versus this year. Next, refuse to be a victim of circumstances. Refuse to be a victim of liars and evil. But here's the most sensitive, refuse to be a victim of yourself. Beware of the thief on the street that's after your purse, but also beware of the thief in your mind that's after your promise.

Like we can't control external events. And we hear all this stuff like meditate, vacation, massage, do all this stuff, but that's great. But what if you're stressed in the moment, right? You're about to give a talk or you're in a difficult conversation or the world seems to be spinning around you. The physiological sigh brings your level of stress down immediately, very quickly, and we all have the capacity to do it. And it's done the following way. It's a double inhale through the nose. The first one is a complete inhale till your lungs feel full. And then you sneak in a little bit more air as a second inhale. And then a long, slow exhale through the mouth until your lungs are completely empty.  "

The worst trait, I think, in people, and a definite trait of negativity, is somebody who can't take any kind of criticism, right? They're so defensive. So that means they can get away with anything. They can say anything they want, and there's just like a wall, a shell around them. A strong character is a person who can take criticism, right? Who can work with other people, right? Who can deal with stressful situations, who can handle responsibility. And if something goes wrong, they take, I am to blame for it. They don't look at other people. There's somebody you can rely on.

You can train your brain to watch those stories come and go without necessarily identifying or attaching to them. And I just think, A, most people aren't aware of that.

Life needs to be lived forward but only makes sense in reverse. Problems are a feature of life, not a book. The real pain in life is getting to the end of it and realizing that you left something on the table. Heroes and villains always have the same backstory here. Pain.

Now, the problem is if you're in very high stress levels for an extended period of time like you are, you can't sleep because you're tired but wired. Your cortisol is spiking through the roof. You're ruminating when you're supposed to be relaxing. Try and stick to a routine because the stress will start to try and expand out and fill all of the gaps in the rest of your schedule. And if you don't have a structure that you lean on, you default to less productivity, less mindfulness. You don't do self-care. You don't train. You don't get sunlight. So try and create rigid rules around when the alarm goes off, I'm out of bed within three minutes. The first thing that I do is step outside or look out of a window or go for a walk or do whatever. Like set rules because if you don't do that, the stress is going to make adhering to things through choice so difficult that you need to buttress and bolster a routine ability. Don't rely on stimulants to wake you up, meds to get you to sleep. I can guarantee you that that is not a phenomenal strategy. Try and do things as naturally as possible. Try and down-regulate wherever you can. Meditate, breath work, stick to a routine, sleep, walk, basics.  "

        "quote": " raw truth about touring and mental health. Touring breaks people in ways that most don't talk about and the industry rarely admits. At its core, touring is chronic displacement. No routine, no grounding, no permanence. Your nervous system never lands. You live in fight or flight. And emotionally, touring swings between extremes. One night, it's 1,500 people screaming. The next, it's a silent hotel room. That kind of cycle burns out even the most resilient people. But the culture of touring rewards stoicism and punishes vulnerability. Your worth becomes about being needed, useful, reliable. And when you finally make it home, you don't feel home. You feel disoriented and numb. Admitting the toll doesn't make you weak. It makes you honest. And that honesty is where real change begins. Yeah, all of that rings true to me. There's an arrested development that happens in touring where you have to make a conscious decision to grow up because it's very feasible and almost encouraged to not. What does not growing up look like? Having a tour manager, having an agent, having riders. She tells you what to do every day. Your food's brought to you. Having shoppers, runners, you need anything. Drop of a hat, it's taken care of. You lose value of substances. You lose value of money and value of time because it's just excess all the time. That's the very baseline all the way up to love, commitment. Relationships are really hard.

When you're driven to work too hard, you actually ignore what matters. These people sacrifice their playfulness, their joyfulness, for the sake of being accepted and being successful and all that.

        "quote": " If you want to be a winner, you've got to think like a winner all the time. Did you know that your ability to achieve success on the outside is directly proportional to the way you think successfully on the inside? The great discovery is that you become what you think about most of the time. The great question is what do you think about most of the time? The degree to which you feel in control of your life will largely determine your level of mental well-being, your peace of mind, your happiness, and the quality of your interactions with other people. And the only thing in the world over which you have complete control is the content of your conscious mind. You decide what to think, no one else. If you decide to exert that control and keep your mind on what you want, even when you're surrounded by difficult circumstances, your future potential can be unlimited. Your aim should be to work on yourself and your thinking until you reach the point where you absolutely, positively believe yourself to be a total winner in anything you sincerely want to accomplish. When you reach the point where you feel an unshakable confidence in yourself and your abilities, nothing will be able to stop you. The first principle is that your thoughts, whatever they are, trigger mental pictures and emotions that then lead to your saying and doing certain things that are consistent with those thoughts. With regard to success, when you think of what success means to you or think about being a great success in your career, you'll think about the things you want to achieve and feel the pleasure of achieving them. You'll talk like a success and begin to take actions that will lead you to the success that you desire. And the starting point is always to think like a winner. The second principle is a paraphrase of the first principle. It says that your feelings will trigger thoughts and mental pictures that will then lead to your saying and doing certain things consistent with those feelings. For example, when you feel positive and optimistic, you'll smile and be cheerful. You'll be more animated and energetic. You'll be more enthusiastic and more efficient and effective in everything that you do. Your positive feelings will trigger positive responses at all levels and your world will be a more positive place. You'll even attract into your life positive people and positive circumstances that are consistent with your feelings. Begin today by practicing these three key principles of personal power and accomplishment. Continually remind yourself to think and imagine and walk and talk and act like the winner you really are. You will be amazed at the results on the outside when you take control of the person you are on the inside.  "

And so this hard thing that has occurred that was not of my choice can still be something that serves me and my ultimate goal to become the type of man who can do these things. Reframing suffering as opportunity to create more proof, I think is really, really strong because we are ultimately just the behaviors that we do. But we also ascribe our narratives to why we do those things, which may or may not be true. Being able to say like, this is going to be an amazing story was one of the things that got me through the earlier parts of the gym days when there wasn't any evidence. And I could say, hey, this was many years of my life because if it had happened overnight, how unrelatable would that story be? And the reason that we don't tell stories of the prince who just goes up to the girl and she says yes, and they lived happily ever after is a very terrible story.

And if you don't have a structure that you lean on, you default to less productivity, less mindfulness. You don't do self-care. You don't train. You don't get sunlight. So try and create rigid rules around when the alarm goes off, I'm out of bed within three minutes. The first thing that I do is step outside or look out of a window or go for a walk or do whatever. Like set rules because if you don't do that, the stress is going to make adhering to things through choice so difficult that you need to buttress and bolster a routine ability. Don't rely on stimulants to wake you up, meds to get you to sleep. I can guarantee you that that is not a phenomenal strategy. Try and do things as naturally as possible.

And what I wasn't aware of when I went to medical school and when I was a physician for decades is how driven I was to justify my existence in the world. When you're driven to work too hard, you actually ignore what matters. These people sacrifice their playfulness, their joyfulness, for the sake of being accepted and being successful and all that. We can all be Winnie the Pooh and Christopher Robin. We can always keep playing in the Enchanted Forest, and that's just essential.  "

But they will not sit down and read poetry. They won't go to a museum and look at artwork. They won't get in touch with the soul. And they for sure will not read the Bible and go to church. But you've got Christians that are the same way. They will do all of the faith stuff. But to go to a gym, to go on a diet, that's why you've got 300-pound preachers with bug eyes spreading the buttons on their shirts standing in a pulpit. They're only a third of a man, okay? They're not taking care of the physical. And they for sure will not listen to Mozart or Reed Longfellow or Kipling. And you go and you sit and you listen to them.

        "quote": " If you want to be a winner, you've got to think like a winner all the time. Did you know that your ability to achieve success on the outside is directly proportional to the way you think successfully on the inside? The great discovery is that you become what you think about most of the time. The great question is what do you think about most of the time? The degree to which you feel in control of your life will largely determine your level of mental well-being, your peace of mind, your happiness, and the quality of your interactions with other people. And the only thing in the world over which you have complete control is the content of your conscious mind. You decide what to think, no one else. If you decide to exert that control and keep your mind on what you want, even when you're surrounded by difficult circumstances, your future potential can be unlimited. Your aim should be to work on yourself and your thinking until you reach the point where you absolutely, positively believe yourself to be a total winner in anything you sincerely want to accomplish. When you reach the point where you feel an unshakable confidence in yourself and your abilities, nothing will be able to stop you. The first principle is that your thoughts, whatever they are, trigger mental pictures and emotions that then lead to your saying and doing certain things that are consistent with those thoughts. With regard to success, when you think of what success means to you or think about being a great success in your career, you'll think about the things you want to achieve and feel the pleasure of achieving them. You'll talk like a success and begin to take actions that will lead you to the success that you desire. And the starting point is always to think like a winner. The second principle is a paraphrase of the first principle. It says that your feelings will trigger thoughts and mental pictures that will then lead to your saying and doing certain things consistent with those feelings. For example, when you feel positive and optimistic, you'll smile and be cheerful. You'll be more animated and energetic. You'll be more enthusiastic and more efficient and effective in everything that you do. Your positive feelings will trigger positive responses at all levels and your world will be a more positive place. You'll even attract into your life positive people and positive circumstances that are consistent with your feelings. Begin today by practicing these three key principles of personal power and accomplishment. Continually remind yourself to think and imagine and walk and talk and act like the winner you really are. You will be amazed at the results on the outside when you take control of the person you are on the inside.  "

I cannot say that I'm the type of man who can withstand hard things without having gone through hard things. And so this hard thing that has occurred that was not of my choice can still be something that serves me and my ultimate goal to become the type of man who can do these things. Reframing suffering as opportunity to create more proof, I think is really, really strong because we are ultimately just the behaviors that we do. But we also ascribe our narratives to why we do those things, which may or may not be true. Being able to say like, this is going to be an amazing story was one of the things that got me through the earlier parts of the gym days when there wasn't any evidence. And I could say, hey, this was many years of my life because if it had happened overnight, how unrelatable would that story be? And the reason that we don't tell stories of the prince who just goes up to the girl and she says yes, and they lived happily ever after is a very terrible story. At the end of our lives, we would much rather have the twists and the turns and the depths of character and then the triumph. This is a story that's far more interesting than this.  "

It's like that is not trying. Like that is not trying. If you cannot count the amount of repetitions that you're having in the hundreds, that is not trying. The longer I've been doing stuff, the greater my history of delay on me getting what I want with volume.

It's mostly because good times are a poor predictor of how you'll handle bad times. And handling bad times is much more important to the success of a marriage. But as a species, as a culture, we have not truly internalized this. It's the lows, not the highs, that make or break a relationship. A painful lesson of the past 20 years of relationships. In the medium run, it's exciting to feel hype about people who seem to relate strongly in specific ways.

That's my purpose, and when I look back one day, I'll know that every step, every struggle, every victory was mine alone. My growth, my journey, that's my legacy.  "

Do I have the consistent will to overcome this thing? Maybe I should break out of this rocking chair and reminisce on the career that was. Maybe this is how my book ends. Maybe far the time has defeated me. Then again, maybe not. It's 3.30am, my foot feels like a dead weight. My head is spinning from the pain meds and I'm wide awake. Forgive my venting, but what's the purpose of social media if I won't bring this to you? No real image. Feels good to vent, let it out, to feel as if this was the worst thing ever.

        "quote": " Confidence and fear both require believing in something that hasn't happened yet. At a certain point, you have to consider that you're choosing to be afraid. Our brain is a prediction machine. Its predictions come in forms of stories about what's going to happen. Is it going to be a good thing? Is it going to be a bad thing? Is it going to go well? You can't stop it. That's just what the brain does. But you don't necessarily have to believe it. You can watch those stories come and go. You can train your brain to watch those stories come and go without necessarily identifying or attaching to them. And I just think, A, most people aren't aware of that. And then, B, even if they are aware of it, it's easy to lose track of what stories or narratives you're buying into or the fact that you can even, like, kind of choose to find more helpful stories to buy into if you want. George Orwell's got this great quote of, like, seeing what's in front of one's nose takes a constant effort. Like, it's often much easier to see what's here than what's here. I love that metaphor just because it's all of this stuff that I write. It's constant.  "

        "quote": " The art of podcasts. This is a quote that I've fallen in love with, this beautiful quote. The magic you are looking for is in the work you're avoiding. The best way to win the game is to stop moving the goalposts. The thing that is making you better is the thing which is making you feel pain. Life needs to be lived forward but only makes sense in reverse. Problems are a feature of life, not a book. The real pain in life is getting to the end of it and realizing that you left something on the table. Heroes and villains always have the same backstory here. Pain. The difference is what they choose to do about it. Villain says, the world hurt me, I'll hurt it back. The hero says, the world hurt me, I'm not gonna let it hurt anybody else.  "
