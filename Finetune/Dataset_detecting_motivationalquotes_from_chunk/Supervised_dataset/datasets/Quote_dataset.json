When my friends were short I pretended that I was short too and if my friend was sad I pretended to be unhappy I could go on and on about all the ways I have limited myself my whole life by waiting for people And the only thing that I've ever received in return is people thinking that they are faster than me people thinking that they can make me feel bad about myself just because I let them and people thinking that I have to do whatever they say I should do My mother used to teach me Cinderella is a perfect example to be but I have learned that Cinderella can go fuck herself I'm not waiting for anybody anymore! I'm going to run as fast as I can fly as high as I can I am going to soar and if you want you can come with me! But I'm not waiting for you anymore"

Compared with the people the planet is doin' great It's been here over four billion years    The planet isn't goin' anywhere folks We are! We're goin' away Pack your shit we're goin' away And we won't leave much of a trace Thank God for that Nothing left Maybe a little Styrofoam The planet will be here and we'll be gone Another failed mutation another closed-end biological mistake"

Where have you buried your best moments? Have you really lived? Look' I say to myself 'how cold it is becoming all over the world!' And more years will pass and behind them will creep grim isolation Tottering senility will come hobbling leaning on a crutch and behind these will come unrelieved boredom and despair The world of fancies will fade dreams will wilt and die and fall like autumn leaves from the trees   "
