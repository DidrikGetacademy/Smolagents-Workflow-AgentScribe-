{ "sentence": " What did you call this? The podcasting booty call? We come together for a very intense three hours.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Don't see each other for six months until I text you again and say what you're doing.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's exactly that. All right. So we're going to go through some of the best lessons I've learned  " }, 

{ "sentence": " from you over the last couple of months. First one. Control freak is a word people with low  " }, 

{ "sentence": " standards use to describe people with high standards. You're not a control freak. You  " }, 

{ "sentence": " just want it done right the first time. You're not anxious. You care. Do not expect mediocre people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to support world-class goals. I think most people feel really lonely when you want something that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " doesn't currently exist. And so some people call that dream. Some people call that goals, whatever  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it is, you're trying to pull something from your mind into reality and you want it done a certain  " }, 

{ "sentence": " way. And if it's not done that way, it's not what you imagined. And so people on the outside will throw  " }, 

{ "sentence": " stones and call you names that they think will change your behavior and get you to stop.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And the more I have been the person trying to pull things into reality, the more I've tried to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " weather and build kind of defenses against those things so that when those stones get hurled at you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " by being called a control freak or by saying you micromanage things or that you have incredibly  " }, 

{ "sentence": " high standards, the answer is yes, because I want it done right the first time. Because either way,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we're going to, if you have enough will, it's going to get done the way that I want it to get done  " }, 

{ "sentence": " regardless. And it'll be less painful if we just do it right the first time, because we will still  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have to do it. And you may have to do it three or four more times, but eventually you will just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " succumb to the fact that we're going to do it this way. And I think all of the great things that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have happened for humanity have been from one man or woman who had an idea and just wouldn't let  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people shake it from them. The standard of right isn't actually that insane when you think about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it. It's just right. It's just done without error. And I guess that the margin that some people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " consider to be right and other people consider to be right just changes.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm trying to think of a really good example for this, but the level of detail, I mean, it's the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " difference between a book that gets 10 or 100 five-star reviews and a book that gets 100,000  " }, 

{ "sentence": " five-star reviews. And everyone wants a silver bullet, but most of the things that make great  " }, 

{ "sentence": " products is 100 golden BBs. And so that's one of the things we have is there's no silver bullets,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " only hundreds of golden BBs. There's just hundreds of tiny little improvements. It's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like, how can we look at the can? How can we improve the way it ships? What about the weight?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What about the color scheme? How does it sit on the shelves? How are people going to look at it in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this market versus this market? Or like, how does this name appear on hats and on shirts and on sites?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And what's the RGB, you know, whatever the color scope is here versus there. And it's just a thousand  " }, 

{ "sentence": " details that someone who does not care will not put the work to look into because they're trying to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " check a box rather than to make something that people will love. Or, um, I heard this from,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " shoot, I can't remember where it was from. Um, but basically that the best art is art where the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " artist makes it for themselves. And where you see commercial work is where a bunch of people are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " trying to make something for an audience. And so it's, they're trying to like rinse and recycle stuff  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that actually solves no one's problems because no one is actually the audience. Whereas when you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " make it for yourself, there's thousands of people just like you who will, who will have the same  " }, 

{ "sentence": " depth of understanding of it, but it feels selfish in the moment to make something for yourself. But  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when you make it for yourself, you actually make it for everyone.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But you can be reliably informed that there's some non insignificant minority of people who also  " }, 

{ "sentence": " think like you. Yes.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Who also have the same problems as you, who also have the same fears as you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So I'm going through two projects at the moment, one being a book and the other being  " }, 

{ "sentence": " new tonic that is nascent and it's new. And that means that there's lots more of these  " }, 

{ "sentence": " small things that are actually quite big things. But I was telling you before we started about the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " fact there's a hyphen and there's a hyphen missing between one piece of copy and another piece of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " copy, but it's printed on a million cans. But being concerned about being seen as someone who has  " }, 

{ "sentence": " too high standards is something that for quite a while I felt ashamed about because you feel like a bother.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You feel like you're being unnecessarily, it's not even detail oriented, it's picky.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Cumbersome.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Laborious. And I realized probably last year, it took me until last year to realize that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " not succumbing to stopping doing that is probably one of the only reasons why I've had any success.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I mean, I think if so, for anyone who's listening, if you have that, I would consider it a gift.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It makes sense for the majority of people to be opposed to that because you do make more work  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for everyone else. But the product of that work is so much better. And so if you want the work that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you have to last and to be meaningful and make an impact, it comes from 100 golden BBs of 100  " }, 

{ "sentence": " particularities of 100 peculiarities that you are picky about, because the whole thing needs to work.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And what happens is if you have a big project, lots of people have to get involved, but there still  " }, 

{ "sentence": " needs to be one vision. And otherwise, it looks like a Frankenstein, where everyone just checks a box  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of something they did in the past, they just copy and paste it over. And then it doesn't resonate  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with anyone. Because again, they just did it for everyone rather than for the artist.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so using that as a frame has given me permission to be me in an unreasonable world.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I told this last time I was on, but when I did the book launch, I practiced that presentation  " }, 

{ "sentence": " three times a day, every day for 30 days. So I did 100 run-throughs, full-length run-throughs.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " First, where I did it out loud and recorded it. Second time, where I would watch the recording  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and then edit in real time and then do it again. And I did that every single day. And so then when  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I came live and had half a million people or whatever, it came out, I think, flawlessly.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But people were like, man, you're such a natural at this. It's like, well, I did it 100 times. And so  " }, 

{ "sentence": " sometimes people even hear 100 and it's just a big number. But when you do 100 repetitions of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " something, the first five times, you're like, wow, I'm so much better. But then the difference  " }, 

{ "sentence": " between five and the next 95 times is what goes from being great to being a masterpiece. And it's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that next 95 that I think is what makes people world-class. And that's where everyone falls  " }, 

{ "sentence": " off. And that's why most people aren't.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " There is this pull, I think, from people who don't have high standards to people who do have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " high standards to drag them back. It's this, like, moving back toward the mean is killing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the only competitive advantage that you had.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Couldn't agree more. It's, I mean, it's conforming, right? It's like they, people want  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you to do what they find comfortable. And most things that are, like, most companies deteriorate  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when the founder leaves, because it happens slowly, because it's, you go to from 100 golden  " }, 

{ "sentence": " babies to 99 golden babies, and it doesn't look that different. And then there's 98 golden  " }, 

{ "sentence": " babies. And they're like, I don't know. And then two years later, three years later, you're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like, I don't know, it doesn't have the same like magic as it what is what it was. And that's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because the art behind it isn't there because it's not unified anymore. It's not congruent  " }, 

{ "sentence": " anymore. It's 100 departments making decisions with people copying, pasting things for an audience  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that doesn't exist rather than one person who's trying to be satisfied for an ideal that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they are trying with all their might to live up to.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I suppose this is one of the important reasons to have a singular figure that is the hub and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " all of the spokes come off it because they're the only person that gets to see absolutely  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everything. And typically that would be the founder in a podcast. That would be a host  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in any other, in a, um, solo music band that would be the lead singer or the songwriter or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " whatever. They get to see everything. For instance, we've done some episodes before where it's been  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the night before, and I've been not happy with the color grade because the way that something  " }, 

{ "sentence": " displays on mobile is slightly different to the way that it displays in Premiere Pro. And it's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " slightly different to the way that it displays in a 6k photographer, videographer's curved screen.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I've gone guys, it's like, it's not up to scratch. Well, we're not going to be able to get it in time  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for the export. We're not going to be able to get it in time to get it uploaded. And then there's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " checks that go through on YouTube. Like, well, it needs to happen. I could just have to make,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " find a way to make this happen. And yeah, that, um, that impulse of just actually seeing it as  " }, 

{ "sentence": " something that you should lean into. Okay. Well, it's not. And if you set the standard and if  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everybody else gets up to that standard, what it shows is the people who continually push up against  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that and don't meet that standard, they're just not built for this particular company. They're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " built for someone else that makes a mediocre product, but they're not built for you. Who's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " making a world-class product? And I, I, I really want to jam down someone's throat right now. Um,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the whole, like, don't be a perfectionist, like you're like, it's just another word for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " procrastination. I actually think that's complete bullshit. I think that that's my quote being, is it  " }, 

{ "sentence": " perfectionism is procrastination masquerading as quality control. Okay. Yes. Okay. So then I'm  " }, 

{ "sentence": " going to, I'm going to put a sub, a sub, a footnote on it that I think will, will add context, which is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that most people who claim to be perfectionists are not perfectionists. They're actually procrastinating  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because they're not doing anything. Correct. And so it just is a socially acceptable label  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because the real perfectionists feel this, this sickness where they like want to itch their skin  " }, 

{ "sentence": " off until the thing's done, but they are trying to get it done. Whereas the perfectionist or the,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the procrastinator uses that to say, like, I'm not sure I'm just getting it right. But like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the person who's an actual perfectionist, one wants to finish and is working every hour of every day  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on the thing and seeing progress towards it. Because if you don't know how your thing is getting better,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're not a perfectionist. You're just ignorant. They're also moving toward the goal every single  " }, 

{ "sentence": " step of the way, as opposed to just sitting back at this huge list of things that are not doing the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to do the thing, isn't doing the thing, thinking about the thing, isn't doing the thing, getting  " }, 

{ "sentence": " angry at people on the internet that have already done the thing, isn't doing the thing. And there's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " also a, people who are perfectionists within the thing that matters most are prepared to see things  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that are ancillary to that. For instance, you're not absolutely a perfectionist. I'm going to guess  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with the short form content that goes out on your Instagram. It's like, this is sawdust,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as you call it. This is just, it's extra, right? It's free, it's freebie stuff. Look,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if we have one in a hundred videos that have got a typo or the hyphens missing or something like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that. All right. But if we're talking about the school announcement release, if there's a fucking  " }, 

{ "sentence": " typo in that, or if in the video, one of the links is broken, or even if one of the links is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " slightly pixelated, that's something that I can have a problem with. So picking your battles as a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " perfectionist, I think actually, or someone, as someone with high standards, is super important  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because you can't have that degree of high standards at absolutely everything. Because if you don't pick  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your battles, you're not going to make sufficient movement at the velocity you need to actually make  " }, 

{ "sentence": " progress. So find the areas that are the highest contribution. Yeah. And don't compromise on those.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And it's funny you say that because I, the way that I immediately reframed that was that the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " perfectionism is around volume is like, that is what we will, that is what we are optimizing towards.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then we can't, because if we look at, if we knew how people responded ahead of time to content,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " then we would make things differently than we do. But I probably like you am often surprised  " }, 

{ "sentence": " pleasantly. And sometimes unpleasantly by the stuff that just grabs hold and then just goes,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know, viral as hell, um, in content. And so I think part of that is making up for our own  " }, 

{ "sentence": " ignorance by increasing volume. And, and so that would be like, if my reframe on the perfectionism  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there is like, we know that if we make 10 pieces of content, it is more likely that we will have more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people see it than if we try really hard at one. And so we make 10 because the net benefit of the 10  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is greater. And so that's the ideal that we commit to Tiago forte has a fantastic take on this where he  " }, 

{ "sentence": " talks about perfectionism allows people to sit back and not produce work at a rate required to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " work out what actually works. Have you heard the, the story of the pottery class? Oh, I feel like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " all right. Well, this feels like total modern. Is this where someone comes in behind and then  " }, 

{ "sentence": " holds the thing in front? So there's two, two, uh, there's a teacher and he's got two classes that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " he teaches. And one class, he says, the only assignment for this whole semester is that you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " come with a, come back with a perfect, uh, clay pot. That's it. That's the assignment. The other  " }, 

{ "sentence": " class, he says, your objective is to make the most total quantity of clay pots. And you'll be measured  " }, 

{ "sentence": " by how many pots you make. And at the end of the quarter, the pots that came from the team that had  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to just make sheer volume, not only did they make more pots, but the quality of all of their pots was  " }, 

{ "sentence": " better compared to the teams that only had to make one. And it just underlines the, the biggest  " }, 

{ "sentence": " lesson that I've learned in my life, which is that volume negates luck is that you can try to be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " lucky and pick the one perfect thing and try and make it. But if you don't want to try and be lucky, you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " can just do so much fucking work that you will, you will brute force your way to figuring it out. Like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you do a thousand podcasts, you'll be pretty fucking good at podcasts, right? But if you try to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " say, okay, you're, you're rent, you're brand new and all you have to do is make one perfect podcast.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The problem is that you don't have the perspective in which to make a judgment to say what is good  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because you have zero data to base anything off of. And so you're basing your idea of a perfect  " }, 

{ "sentence": " podcast on something that you've literally never done before. And so doing the volume gives you put  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the perspective to then have the best podcast at number 1000 or 1001. Anyways, I just thought you'd  " }, 

{ "sentence": " love the clay pot. I know that story, but I thought it was photography. So anyway, but again,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I don't disagree. And it's finding the thing that is to try and make this tactical. What is the thing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that you don't need to focus on volume today? The goal is not to try and fit 10 podcasts into one  " }, 

{ "sentence": " set. It's to make this one as good as possible. But if it's shorts or reels or tweets or something,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's lower leverage, it's lower input, just get it out there. All right, next one.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Here's how to get older without getting better. Keep relearning the same lesson.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " If you keep making the same mistake over and over, the mistake isn't the problem. You are.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So I define learning by same condition, new behavior. And so when you go to a video game,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and you battle through the level and you battle the boss, if you keep doing the same thing to the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " boss, and you keep losing, then you have not learned because you have the same condition and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the same behavior. And so I often say that, like for anyone who's listening to this podcast,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if the goal is to get better, and you're like, man, I really want to learn something from this  " }, 

{ "sentence": " podcast. If you listen to this podcast, and then you're in the same exact conditions as you were  " }, 

{ "sentence": " before, and then you do not change your behavior, you learned nothing. And so using that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " definition has at least allowed me to change my behavior faster, which then goes into rate of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " learning, which I define as intelligence. And so a lot of people are like, man, he's so smart,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but he just doesn't. It's like, well, then if he doesn't change his behavior, and he's in the same  " }, 

{ "sentence": " conditions, he's a dummy. He's not that smart. And so if you are trying to battle the same boss over and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " over again, and you don't change what you're doing, and the boss keeps beating you, then it's not the game  " }, 

{ "sentence": " problem. It's your problem. You are the problem. And I think that's, like, if you if you continue,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I talked about obviously, I talked to a lot of entrepreneurs. But I usually do this when I have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a crowd, just like, hey, raise your hand if you work all the hours of the day. And a lot, you know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " most of the crowd raised their hand, I say, Okay, who here has been stuck at the same revenue level  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for six months or more. And then I said, keep the hands up. And like, honestly, most of the time,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the same hands are raised, I say, you're doing the wrong shit. Like if you put all your inputs,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and the outputs haven't changed, then you have the same condition, and the same behavior. And so you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have learned nothing. And so that has always just been my reframe. And so over time, if if you're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " moving up in entrepreneurship, you're moving up in career, your behavior should change,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because it means you've learned. Exposure to information isn't learning. Great deal you are.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's true. It's true. And it's the same with memory. It's literally the way that memory works.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The best way to work out how the human memory system works is repeated recall, not repeated exposure,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right? You have to drag it out of memory and use it, not just see it a million times. And this is kind  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of the same thing with the lesson. It's, you can listen to any of the podcasts that exist on the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " internet, or the ones that we've done, or the ones that you love, or whatever. And if you don't apply  " }, 

{ "sentence": " anything, it's a waste of time. And this is the best solution for this is Tim Ferriss is the good  " }, 

{ "sentence": " shit sticks. Look, what's the thing from the podcast or the book or the audio book or the whatever  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that you read or listen to that you can't stop thinking about, that you go to bed and you think about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it, that you took a screenshot or a screen recording and send it in the group chat that you like texted  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your mum about it at three in the morning. Oh, this really explains the way that I felt in school  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or the way that I felt when such and such broke up with me or whatever. That's the thing. That's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the thing to focus on. But a lot of the time, the problem with mental masturbation is that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the amount of information you can intake versus the amount of change that you can deploy is asymmetric.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. When I was getting started in my entrepreneurial journey, and I would say  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this was like pre this, I was when I was a wantrepreneur, right? Like I hadn't quit my job  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yet. I started reading all these self-help books. And I remember reading like, it was probably like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " my 10th book in a row. And I realized that the words in that book contradicted like the second  " }, 

{ "sentence": " self-help book that, you know, one was like, it's all about goals. The other one's like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's all about taking steps or whatever it was. Right. And I, and I, all of a sudden I was like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know, my life is the same. I've read all these books, but my, I still literally live in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the exact same condo in Baltimore doing the same job. Like nothing has changed. And so I just made  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the commitment that whatever the next book that I was going to read, I would just not read another  " }, 

{ "sentence": " book until I'd done everything in that book. And I, that's when I quit my job and I did a whole bunch  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of other things. And I've actually more or less stuck with that in terms of like, when I read books  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or even listen to podcasts, I usually do with an intention to get something out of it. And I usually  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have notes up. And so that's, so my intake on information, cause I, because I get asked a lot,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm sure you do. Like I actually don't read that much. Um, I definitely don't read nonfiction. I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " read like fantasy. Red rising baby. That's right. Um, but it's because usually I get overwhelmed with  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the amount of things I would have to do. And so I'm like, I don't need more information. I'm like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm like, I could read a chapter and be like, all right, that's it. I like, it'll take me two weeks  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to do this. And so then like the rest of the time is doing that. And so how do you ensure that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the things that you're reading are giving you good advice? Because if you didn't move on before  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you took two weeks to go and do the thing, the thing was dog shit. You've spent two weeks going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " backward. So I would probably, I would make the argument that I wouldn't have gone backwards  " }, 

{ "sentence": " cause I would have gained the experience. And so I would have more context to know what the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " second thing was going to be. And that's just kind of like the trial by fire learning through  " }, 

{ "sentence": " iteration. And I think I tend to do more of that. Um, sort of a win or learn philosophy.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. And I would say that like there, there are entrepreneurs who are definitely like super,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " super duper planners and their entrepreneurs who are more like, let's just move and break  " }, 

{ "sentence": " shit and we'll figure it out. I tend to be really this on the micro in terms of like move  " }, 

{ "sentence": " shit and break, you know, like we'll figure it out as we go. And I just tend to be a planner  " }, 

{ "sentence": " only in the big, like very grand, like what do I really want to do in 10 years? But the majority  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of the time it's like, let's see. And we'll, we'll, we'll learn. I've learned so much,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like so much of the content that I have comes from just fucking up in business. And people were  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like, this is such original content. I was like, this is just cause that's what my life was. I just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like, I made this mistake and it didn't work, but I said this one thing one time and then all these  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people bought and I was like, Ooh, how do I do that again? And so like, it was always through  " }, 

{ "sentence": " iteration. And I, I've read all these books, but there's just me knowing how, uh, or sorry,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " knowing that and knowing how, like knowing that maybe this works maybe, but once you do it,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's a different type of learning where at least for me, it's about been that way. If you could read,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you could read a hundred books on sales, but when you take your first cold call,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " all of that goes out the window because you actually have to, you actually have to sell.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " We'll get back to talking to Alex in one minute, but first I need to tell you about Element.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Element is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with everything that you need and nothing that you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " don't. Stop having coffee first thing in the morning. Your adenosine system that caffeine acts on  " }, 

{ "sentence": " isn't even active for the first 90 minutes of the day, but your adrenal system is and salt act on your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " adrenal system. Element contains a science backed electrolyte formula of sodium, potassium,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and magnesium that helps to regulate your appetite, curb cravings, and improve your brain health.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " This orange flavor is absolutely insane. It is the best way to start the day. It's a beautiful,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " salty, orangey drink. It's refreshing if you've been doing hot exercise and it's just my favorite  " }, 

{ "sentence": " way to wake up. I've been using Element every single morning for over three years now, and it's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " still just as enjoyable as when I first used it. Right now, you can get a free sample pack of all eight  " }, 

{ "sentence": " flavors with your first box by going to the link in the description below or heading to drinklmnt.com  " }, 

{ "sentence": " slash modernwisdom. That's drinklmnt.com slash modernwisdom.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " This is related to something I wrote last week. Don't be so worried about people who imitate your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " work. They only know the what, but not the why. If you stopped being creative, so would they. A  " }, 

{ "sentence": " photocopier isn't an artist, even if it can recreate the Mona Lisa.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I love that. Because even like you, you are source in that situation. And so everyone is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there for like a subset of you and they require you to live. You don't require them. And the equal  " }, 

{ "sentence": " opposite is, I think we should be more fearful of when everyone stops copying you. Like the day that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " no one copies you is far, far more frightening than the day everyone's copying you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. Jimmy Carr refers to China as a cover band.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You know, it's like they're the cover band of the Beatles. And he says, you know, they're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " good. And in many ways they're able to produce things at more scale and so on and so forth,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but they're not driving the innovation forward in that same way.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. The idea of getting upset about people copying is just ridiculous. Like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yeah, that's all I, that's all I got on that. But you understand why it's painful, right?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " If someone's gone through, okay, let's test and test and test and test and test,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and then finally find a particular form of that formula that works. And then 10 people downstream  " }, 

{ "sentence": " get the benefit of this hard, laborious, effortful, late night grind and iteration.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And they just got to be like, oh, that thing. Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. I, so I think that like they, they'll be able to copy what they can see, but they won't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " be able to copy what they can't see, which is understanding why each of those pieces are in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " place. And when something changes in the future, they won't be able to iterate from there because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they don't know why it was there in the first place. Right. And so like, I mean, I've obviously  " }, 

{ "sentence": " dealt this with in a business context where like real dollars are at stake. And so like in the gym  " }, 

{ "sentence": " world, you know, gym launch for those who don't know, I had a big licensing company. We had 5,000  " }, 

{ "sentence": " locations and anyways, so we had basically business processes that we would, you know, iterate and figure out  " }, 

{ "sentence": " why this worked. And so then I had, I used to keep a list of names and then I just, it got too long  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and tiresome to keep the names of all the people who tried to take the stuff and then sell it as their  " }, 

{ "sentence": " own. I say, I say their names every night before I go to bed. You think I don't remember you. I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " remember all of you. And so none of them 10 years later are still around and not, and none of them  " }, 

{ "sentence": " even came to a 10th of the size of gym launch. And it was because it wasn't theirs. Like the person that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I would be far more afraid of somebody who comes out with a significantly better system than what  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we had to help gyms make more money and help their, you know, help their clients more. Um,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but like to this day, like there still isn't one and that one's 10 months is still the category  " }, 

{ "sentence": " king in that, in, in that industry. And so it's like, just, and that's because we put,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and we were talking about this earlier, everything is an R and D for us. And so we actually like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we're the only licensing company that had an R and D department and we would test,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " uh, we call them plays, but we test plays every, every 14 days. And so we'd spend 50 or a hundred  " }, 

{ "sentence": " grand on just a test. We'd be like, all right, let's test this new marketing campaign. Or we'd  " }, 

{ "sentence": " say, Hey, let's test this new, uh, high ticket sales processor. Hey, what if we did, what if we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " tried to sell memberships via chat? Let's just give it a shot, see what happens. And, and honestly,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " 70% of the time it would, it was worse than the control. Like it didn't work as well. And what we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " would do is we'd present it to the licensees and say, Hey guys, guess what? We just spent 50 grand on  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that you don't have to spend money on. Look at the results of this cell membership.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Total dog shit.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. The thing is, is that most people are actually really happy to, to know that it  " }, 

{ "sentence": " didn't work because it felt like they were scratching and it's like, Oh great. I don't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have to do that one. Like someone did that test for me. So anyways, um, all that to say, uh,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " unless you have that, that trail of bodies behind you that led you to figure out this one thing when  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there is a kink in the system, because some external condition changes, which it always will,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they then don't know, which means you're always still going to be ahead.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. That's very interesting. Yeah. Because if you understand the physics of the system,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you understand the dynamics of why you're doing the things that you're doing and something  " }, 

{ "sentence": " changes, you can respond, but it goes back to people with high standards.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You have to presume that you win in the weeds. You have to presume that you win in the weeds.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And if you do, and if you're continuing to be this close to it, as soon as things change, you go,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Hmm, that's interesting. Why has that happened? And that then allows you to continue to iterate.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And you see it because you're in the weeds, right? Somebody who's all the way zoomed out,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " just like, yeah, copy paste that. They're like, they're one, they're late because they have to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " see that it's working, see that it's working consistently. So they're already three, six months  " }, 

{ "sentence": " behind. Then they start trying to figure out how to implement it. And then they start implementing it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then what they don't see is the things that made the conditions that made it work to begin  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with. And so like, if you just assume that you're always in the lead, then it means then sure,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " second through 10th place will always copy number one, but to the victory go the spoils. And so you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " will like, no one gives a who is fourth place at the Olympics.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Reminder that if you want to be exceptional, you're going to be different from everyone else.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That's what makes you exceptional. You can't fit in and also be exceptional. Both have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " discomfort. When you fit in, you have internal conflict because you're not being 100% you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " When you're exceptional, you have external conflict because everyone sees you as different.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Pick one. When your friends start to say, you've changed, remember it's because they don't know how  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to say you've grown.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I define words a lot because it helps me kind of like made sense of the world. And um, like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " exceptional is, it's like an obvious one, right? We use the word exceptional, like you are not like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everyone else. Um, but even saying it like that, like you are not like everyone else.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so if someone says you're not like everyone else, then you can just reframe that as like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I am exceptional and that's not a bad thing. Um, and most, and I, I don't, and I actually think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that most people have like, this might be counter to most people's beliefs, but I think most people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have the potential to be exceptional. And because most people are peculiar in their own way. They just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " stifle that because they want to be accepted by most people, but in so doing never accomplish what  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they want to do because they conform. Uh, and so like, if there's probably a lot of things about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the world or even your world around you that you're like, this never made sense to me, but then you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " do it anyways. And I, I think that a lot of innovation and a lot of what makes people exceptional  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is feeling, you know, thinking that thought or seeing that thing and then being like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " huh, I don't think I'm going to follow that rule anymore.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, why do I need to shower twice a day? Huh? Like, I don't know. Like, why do I need to wear  " }, 

{ "sentence": " different clothing? Huh? Like, there's just a lot of these social norms that people, you know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " usually pass down to us or they're, you know, bred into us in high school and college and things like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that. Um, but it's like, you see a guy who, you know, wears a cowboy hat and dresses a certain way.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And he basically wants to say, I am this, I am this archetype of person. But if cowboy boots  " }, 

{ "sentence": " known as comfortable for you as new balances are, and you know that, and you still wear cowboy boots,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I would call you a fraud because like, that is like, it's a, it's like a micro rebellion against  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yourself is like, there is. And like, I look at old people a lot because usually they don't give a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " shit anymore. They've just like given up. And, uh, there was a survey that they did where the number  " }, 

{ "sentence": " one reason that old people like don't have as much drama and they're happier as they say, they,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they cited, they literally don't have time for it. Like literally they don't have time for it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I found that so interesting. And I was like, well, if I'm going to eventually be that way  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when I'm 80, I might as well just start being that way now. And so they usually wear like really  " }, 

{ "sentence": " comfortable footwear and like they, they keep their surroundings, like whatever weird peculiarities  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they have, they just accept them. And so I think a lot of like, if, if life is a long journey of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " self-acceptance, I think the earlier you can accept your own peculiarities as just part of you,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " rather than trying to justify them or mold to what you, to the archetype that you think is acceptable  " }, 

{ "sentence": " within your social circle. Um, at least for me, like there's this period of discomfort when you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " change anything because everyone around you wants you to fit within the label that they are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " comfortable with. But they also have the anchor of what you were before.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah, exactly. And so they try and like, they, they, people don't like that. And so they're like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " no, no, I like you in this box. So just say, I, I know you're having a little thing right now.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Don't worry. Just, just, and they just want to shove you back into it. And there's,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there's a lot of uncomfortable conversations that you have to have where it becomes really  " }, 

{ "sentence": " socially awkward. Um, and so like I said one the other day about like going home for the holidays.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And the reason I don't like doing it is because often I have to confront a lot of people that I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " haven't seen in a long time and they'll speak to me in a way that I don't like. And before that,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I would roll it off, like whatever, no big deal. But, um, I don't accept that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Didn't you torpedo a family holiday a couple of years ago?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Many.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah, I think, but that's the, when your friends start to say you've changed,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's because they don't know how to say you've grown.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And because they see so few people who have, so it makes sense that they don't have that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So I see that as a lack of skill, not, not malice. Like it's not that they're bad people. They just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " don't even know it because so few people do change. So few people do grow.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Have you seen this image? It's a person whose heart and head are flowers. It's kind of a 2D  " }, 

{ "sentence": " drawing. It's a bit of a sketch. And, um, they say this person with the kind of smaller flower head  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and heart says you've changed. And the person on the other side with this huge blooming thing says,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I should hope so.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. I haven't seen it, but I see it in my head.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. It's brilliant. One of my friends, George Mack told me this five years ago, I think,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm astounded by how many people want to be spectacular in life, but also want to be normal.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " By being normal, you are by definition, aiming for average. Normal people get normal results.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Exceptional people get exceptional results. You literally can't do what everyone else does  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and expect to not get what everyone else has got. By doing what everyone else does,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you guarantee average results.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Okay. So this comes down to everything that like business, I mean, obviously I come from  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the business and investing world. Um, like if everyone is jumping onto crypto,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like by the time you have all the information to make a perfect decision, it's too late.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And by the time you have consensus where everyone's like, that's a good investment,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it probably isn't because it's already been mispriced because it's already like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's already inflated and it's above what its intrinsic value is. And so like good investors  " }, 

{ "sentence": " fundamentally can think for themselves. And it's such an easy thing to say and such a hard thing to do.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so it's being able to say, if I shut myself in a room and I had to come up with a value for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " something and just use my own mind to come up with what I think this is worth. It's that, that answer  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that you get in a room in isolation with no internet connection, that you believe in that number more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " than every single other person's. And most people can't do that, but like that ability. And then what  " }, 

{ "sentence": " happens though, is if you really have to believe in that rather than everyone else's, you double check  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your fucking math. Because if it is different than everyone else's, you have the op, you like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that is what opportunity looks like. It's called advantage.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Right. It's like, and you have the potential to make a shitload of money or lose a ton of money  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because you didn't check your math. And so the more I've been reinforced for thinking  " }, 

{ "sentence": " independently and in the beginning, it's on small things. And then you just continue to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " reinforce that cycle of, huh? I came to this conclusion on my own. It seems different than  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everyone else's, but I think, I think my thing makes sense. So I'm going to do that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " How would you advise someone to overcome that regression to the mean, that pull to not  " }, 

{ "sentence": " make waves, to not be heterodox or non-typical when it comes to their decision-making? Because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's hard. You're talking about this internal conflict versus external conflict. How do you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " make the internal conflict more important than the external conflict?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " For me, I was more miserable trying to make everyone else happy than I am now with everyone  " }, 

{ "sentence": " else unhappy with me. And so I think like from the social group that I had before I quit my job,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " before going all the way like ground zero to today, I talked to no one from that time in my life  " }, 

{ "sentence": " compared to today. And I was absolutely miserable and unhappy and unfulfilled. And I would say that the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " majority of those people probably don't like me today because I changed. I didn't do what I was  " }, 

{ "sentence": " supposed to do. He thinks he's so fancy now, et cetera, et cetera. And I think I'm just okay with  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that. And so I think coming to terms with the idea that I could be absolutely rejected by everyone I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " know, but like me, I was more okay with that because the alternative was I didn't want to live  " }, 

{ "sentence": " anymore. And so obviously there's degrees and there's continuums and there's stages of where people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are at with that. But as that being the taken to its logical extreme, would I rather live for them  " }, 

{ "sentence": " than live for me? I would rather be hated by everyone and like myself.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " There's a degree of honesty is the right word, but it's also too simple. Like being completely 100%  " }, 

{ "sentence": " truthful with yourself. If that's the way that this is why I told you about the motocross,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the rally cross thing that me and my housemate love. Okay. So, you know, like Colin McRae,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " these guys that drive four wheel, there's the dude in the co-pilot seat and it's five left bend,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " all that shit. These guys that go to go and watch this are in the middle of some  " }, 

{ "sentence": " fucking wood in Ayrshire, right? In Scotland and it's pissing wet and it's November and they've got a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " poncho on and they get to drive for however long to get to this place. You can even see thinking about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it. The hairs on my arms are standing up. This is how fucking dope it is. So these guys are there  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and they see some dude in overcast rain, freezing cold, soaking wet, go  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and then they turn to all of their boys and they're like, watching someone who loves  " }, 

{ "sentence": " anything with that much purity fires me up. It fires me up. Like we love watching. We don't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " watch it for what the cars are doing. We watch it for what it does to the spectators. And that degree  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of like just unencumbered passion. Yeah. Not being apologetic. Like they've probably,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they're probably wearing comfy shit. They're not wearing cowboy boots. You know what I mean?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " No one, they look like a, like a large condom in this poncho. Do they care? They don't care. And  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's purity. Yeah. That's truthfulness and honesty. And really, like what, what are you hoping  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to be able to look back on your life or for people to say after you're gone, if you don't do that?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " He was such a good guy and he never rocked the boat. Yeah. He was such a good guy and he always  " }, 

{ "sentence": " conformed to our expectations. He was such a good guy and he was so predictable. Right.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like people think, and I did throughout a lot of my twenties, I thought that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what people wanted from me was someone that they could easily predict.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But I realized when I thought about the people that I loved in my life,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I didn't love them because of how predictable they were. Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I loved them because of how unapologetically themselves they were. I have a friend who nearly  " }, 

{ "sentence": " ended a relationship that he's still with, who he, the love of his life, who's probably going to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " end up marrying because he refused to not sleep on the floor for six months as part of a, Alex  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Becker's doing it at the moment. Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like he's like, sleeping on the floor seems to be like a pretty dialed idea. And she's like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm not sleeping on the floor. Well, I am. So, so they didn't sleep together for like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know, for like a long time. Yeah. Like that's, those are the people that you love. And those  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are the people that you can, because they pay such a high price to do that. Yeah. You can be very  " }, 

{ "sentence": " reliable at presuming that they mean what they're saying, because if they didn't really mean what  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they're saying, they would conform, they would take an easier path. I love all of that. My,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I was trying to kind of consolidate it for, for myself and the listeners. For me, it, it just,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it comes down to truly valuing your opinion of yourself more than other people's opinion of you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And it's, it's just, it's an easy thing to say, and it's incredibly hard to do because that means that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you disagree with everyone else in the room, there's this meme that I love. I don't know if  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you've seen it. There's this little cartoon of this one little guy, and then there's like an ocean  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of people that way. And it just says, yes, you're all wrong. And I just like, I feel like that meme,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I, I, I, my, uh, Joe Rikashi, my, my, uh, brother and editor in the books in the battle against  " }, 

{ "sentence": " nihilism and, and, and, and towards truth. Um, we send that meme back and forth to one another,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when we're like, yes, everyone is wrong about this word. Like we are right. And I think it's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " just being willing to like, but the only way you can believe in a thing or an idea or even yourself  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is because you have the evidence behind you that supports that your belief isn't full of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " shit. So that when you're in that room and you come up with that one number and you say,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think everyone's wrong. I think this is actually what it's worth.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You're not just making it up to, to say you believe something different.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You actually have proof and evidence that you're not full of shit. And I think that's the work is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like, I did a, I looked into a lot of the stuff on this, on the floor sleeping. I think it checks  " }, 

{ "sentence": " out. I'm going to do it. Like, I think everyone else is wrong. I think everyone else is wrong.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And everyone's like, you're an idiot. And you're like, I think you're wrong. And that's okay.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You know what I mean? And it's just, most people can't do that. Just the idea of being weird  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is too much. Like, just like... Did you ever see, did you ever, um, this is quite old now.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's at least a decade old. I think it's called 50 days of rejection or a hundred days of rejection.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I love it already. So it's a, it's a, a series of experiments that you do every day for a hundred  " }, 

{ "sentence": " days. Yeah. And there's a different one each day. And, uh, one of them is ask for a free coffee when  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you go to Starbucks. Oh, I love it. Just say, Hey, can I have this for free? Yeah. And it's,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I don't know whether it escalates over time, but there's like weird stuff, things that you do to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people in public, things that blah, blah, blah. And it's trying to overcome that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like it sort of, it's in your throat, you know, when you feel that and your cheeks get flush and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everything kind of gets hot. You get embarrassed around here. Yeah. It's that embarrassment.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's that shame. It's that, well, what if they think? Yeah. What? Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What if they think what? Yeah. So yeah, I, I, someone should redo that. It's like a decade  " }, 

{ "sentence": " old now, but someone should redo, I think I'm certain it's called a hundred days of rejection.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Good YouTube idea. That'd be a great YouTube idea to do a hundred,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a hundred days of rejection or whatever it is. Um, all right, next one.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I just want to like, I promise you, if you can actually go through a hundred days of rejection,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your life will change because you will realize that at the end of the hundred days,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're still alive and nothing changed. But it's I'm going to die. Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That's the fear. The fear is I'm going to ask for the coffee and they're going to say no.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then everyone's going to laugh at me and then I'm going to be alone and then I'm going to be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " unsheltered and then I'll be dead. Yeah. It's catastrophized to death. We all do it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so, I mean, obviously I come from a sales background, so getting people to say no to me is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " something that I'm now. If you've asked drunken Newcastle girls where they're going tonight,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " darling for a decade and a half on the street, trying to give out wristbands for a free entry to a club  " }, 

{ "sentence": " night no one wants to go to, you get good at rejection as well. That's why I honestly think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that everyone is always going to campaign for the thing that they did, right? You're always going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to say something along the lines of, I think people can learn a lot from sales. And I'm always going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to say, I think people can learn a lot from being in club promo. But like, honestly, dude, the insight  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that you get into human nature from doing that, from seeing what do people object to and why do they  " }, 

{ "sentence": " object in that way? And what happens if someone like gets physical with you because you've tried to do,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and you go, oh, well, I wasn't in the wrong. So deescalating this should actually be quite easy.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I can have faith that everyone's going to see me as the right guy, even if somebody else took  " }, 

{ "sentence": " objection with what I was doing. So yeah, long story short, become a club promoter. All right,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " next one, next one. There's a big difference between becoming known and becoming respected.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Don't let an algorithm convince you otherwise.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I mean, I think this is probably super pertinent for people in our position. But  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'll go from the internet perspective, and we can circle back to IRL. But I mean, a lot of people will  " }, 

{ "sentence": " make content. So obviously, I make stuff for me to like talk about artists making things for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " themselves. Like I make most of my tweets are just like notes to self. But like, if I ever feel  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like I have to sacrifice who I am or the values that I believe in, in order to like get more views  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or something like that, I see it happen more times than not. Because the algorithm and the views and the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " likes become kind of a proxy for conforming in their own way. Like everyone likes this type of thing,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " do more of that. And that makes me feel very like dance monkey dance. And I think there's few things  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that kill my soul more than that. And so I would rather, you know, I'd rather the algorithm shut me off  " }, 

{ "sentence": " tomorrow. And I continue to make stuff that I find interesting, that 10 people find interesting,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that is actually the same stuff as me, then just have these viral hits that I feel like I'm Ronald  " }, 

{ "sentence": " McDonald in. And just feel like I've completely lost my soul. And I do think as a side note,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that if you do the first one where your intention is to maybe help find the 10 people who are really  " }, 

{ "sentence": " interested in your thing, you probably will create more of the viral hits. But when you solve for the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " other way, I think you accomplish neither. I have this theory that more creators fall  " }, 

{ "sentence": " out of favor, because they become cringe than because they become irrelevant.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I love that. Yeah, I love that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think it's, I think it's true. I think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you think about the thing that you do, almost anything that anybody is creating is public facing,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because it wasn't public facing, it would just be a hobby. Doing your painting because you love  " }, 

{ "sentence": " painting is a hobby. Doing your painting to try and sell it is something that you do as a business  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or as a public project. The flywheel is so vicious in the positive direction and even more vicious  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in the negative direction. If it becomes cancerous or uncool or untrendy or catastrophic  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or cringe to be seen to be watching or listening to or consuming the thing that you make, you're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " permanently going to be swimming upstream and it is only going to get worse. Which is why you look  " }, 

{ "sentence": " at Shane Gillis is a really great example of this at the moment. He's someone who is great at his craft,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " big platform, moved to Austin, got all of the multipliers in place, but he isn't cringe.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And because he's not cringe, if you've watched Beautiful Dogs, his Netflix special, it's not uncool.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, there's this idea in publishing, because I've been doing my research ahead of the book.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " There's this idea in publishing called the subway test. Would someone be prepared to have the full  " }, 

{ "sentence": " dust jacket version of your book out on the subway? And if your book is like, stop erectile dysfunction now.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The erection problem, right?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like no more flatulence today or something. If that's your book, it's going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to be very difficult. Or if it's written by somebody where it's like, oh, really don't want to do that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And this is the point where there are tons and tons and tons of people on the planet who have huge  " }, 

{ "sentence": " platforms that nobody respects. And I've seen, even within my seven year career of doing this,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the arc of people trade integrity for exposure and not be able to buy it back.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because there is no return policy on your integrity.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " On your reputation.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And those people would give anything to be back in the cool kids club.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I mean, this is a, like, I love this entire train.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I was thinking like, what creates, like, what's timelessly not cringe, right? So like, if cringe is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the ultimate, like, what we don't want, then like, what is forever not cringe? And the only thing that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I can like really think of is, is just true authenticity, which is an overused word, but  " }, 

{ "sentence": " again, easy to say, hard to do. I think what is, what is forever cringe on the equal opposite side  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is, is pandering. Like whenever you're seen as someone who's only doing stuff for other people's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " opinion, approval, likes, whatever, especially double cringe when it's for your own personal gain.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so if the equal opposite of that is something that is to my personal detriment,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that is truly something that I believe in, it honestly doesn't matter what it is,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because there are some people that probably believe things that I don't believe. But I genuinely think,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " based on what I see, that they genuinely believe it. And it's, and they don't really stand to gain  " }, 

{ "sentence": " much for believing it. Yeah. There's no cringe there. It's just like, that fan, that man fucking  " }, 

{ "sentence": " believes that. And I think that some of the, you know, some of the characters in our current,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know, politosphere and things like that, like, many people, you know, you say the word Trump,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and you have half the, you know, people who hate you, and the other half that love you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, I think most people agree that he believes what he says. Now, whether you believe the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " content of what he's saying is a different story. But like, I don't think many people have called  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think he's, he doesn't really think that about himself. Like, no, I think he, I think he really  " }, 

{ "sentence": " does. And even, I'm just gonna push the edges, because that's where you have to like explore the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " fringe. Look at someone like Kanye, who's been borderline canceled for, I mean, multiple times,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right? But like, why is Kanye quote uncancellable? Because he hasn't been, right? Not really. Like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if he came out tomorrow with a hit, a hit album, I'll bet you it would fucking sell. Because I think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that at least for me, from what I see, I think he does what he believes. And people might be like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " he's mentally unstable, there's all these other things. But like, no one's thinks he's being fake.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I think that like, if that becomes the North Star of like, I just never want to become cringe,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " then it's just never be fake. In other news, this episode is brought to you by  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Maric Health. I wanted to get my blood work done last year. And after a ton of research,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I found that Maric Health has the most sophisticated and comprehensive service in America.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " In fact, I loved the process so much that I reached out to the owner to partner with them on the show,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because that's how much I believe in their service. They don't just provide you with supplements,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they also suggest lifestyle interventions, training, diet, and everything else. It really is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " insanely comprehensive. It's great to feel like you have someone professionally trained,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " who is in your corner, helping you to understand what's going on inside of your own body.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " When I started working with Maric, my testosterone was 495, which isn't super low, but isn't great.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And after six months of working with them, it was at 1006. So in less than six months,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they more than doubled my testosterone without using TRT. Right now, you can get the exact same  " }, 

{ "sentence": " blood panel and service that I got with a 10% discount by going to the link in the description  " }, 

{ "sentence": " below or heading to marichealth.com slash modernwisdom and the code modernwisdom at checkout.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That's m-a-r-e-k health.com slash modernwisdom and modernwisdom at checkout.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think that avoiding cringe and aligning authenticity as best you can, and it's a permanent battle,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because you are not inside of a vacuum and you see other people doing things and there is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " temptation and you need to respond to the audience's feedback in some regard, or else you're just going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to be making something that nobody fucking cares about, but you also need to not compromise too much.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " One of your old ones related to this, people are attracted to authenticity,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but it's hard to define for me. Here's my best attempt. True alignment of what you think,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what you say, and what you do. The hardest part is realizing that our thoughts are fucked  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and that we have to fix them instead of faking the next two.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I wholeheartedly agree. You said it. Man. Yeah, that's dead on.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I've got a really cool idea. Herostratic fame. Many people would rather be hated than unknown.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " In ancient Greece, Herostratus burned down the temple of Artemis purely so that he would be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " remembered. Nowadays, we have nuisance influencers who stream themselves committing crimes and harassing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people purely for clout. Herostratic fame. Yeah. That's like the, you gain the world,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but you lose your soul. Kind of. I mean, I, I'm also the last person to judge. Uh, and so like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if that's what you want, then by all means do it. I don't think it's what people want. I think that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they, they think it's what they want. I've been playing with this idea or this name. One of the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " concepts that the book will be focused on intentionalism and essentialism by Greg McEwen is one  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of my favorite ever books. And I've figured it would be a nice, like hat nod, doing what you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " mean to do and wanting what you want to want is so fucking hard to do. And so rare because we're built to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " conform. I think one of the, my life goals, and I can summarize it in a question, but, um,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is to be fearless. And it's, I mean, equal opposite courage is another word, but I love this question,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " which is what would you do if you weren't afraid? And I just, I love thinking about that when I'm  " }, 

{ "sentence": " thinking about big life decisions, like, what would I do if I weren't afraid? And it's usually like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the big one, the bigger thing that I really want to do, but I'm afraid to do it. It's like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's what I should do. Um, and to your point about you had the five things that you told your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " team though, one that we have is, um, originally it was something that we called one of one,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " which is make only things that we can make. Like you'll never see a Coca-Cola business breakdown  " }, 

{ "sentence": " from Alex Ramosi because anyone can do a Coca-Cola business breakdown. That's not one of one content.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But if I say I doubled the sales of this company by implementing these four things,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " no one else can say that because no one else did it. Right. And so it's one of one. And so  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as the book lunch and whatnot came, um, we took one of one and it became this big, massive thing.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And it wasn't stopping about like, what can only do things that only we can do. It was about doing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " things that we didn't even know we could do yet, which became one of zero. And that's why that became  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the brand that I'm going to continue to wear for the next few years, um, and build that association.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But I think that that kind of encapsulates my personal life goal, which is like, what would I do  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if I weren't afraid? And what would I do if I didn't, if I knew I couldn't fail. And the idea that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I will never wish for fewer epic stories at the end of my life. And I've never regretted failures.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I've always regretted things that I didn't try. And so just along those lines of trying to create  " }, 

{ "sentence": " more bias internally towards action rather than inaction and normalizing consequences of failure,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as, as we said earlier, winner learn. And I think that that little frame, believe it or not,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " um, for anyone who's like on the teetering edge of like, what should I do that thing?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " When I was debating quitting my job, which is still the hardest decision I've made to,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to this day, still of the many that I've made, um, was I figured that if I didn't make the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " entrepreneurship thing work, I would have a hell of a story for business school.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And that was actually like the, the reasoned argument that I gave myself for being willing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to quit was that I think that with my experience, I'll still be able to get a job and I'll have a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " really cool story of entrepreneurship that I could use to apply to get into business school  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and then eventually get a job later. And so most times we catastrophize any failure to death,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right? Which is like, I'm going to, I'm going to fail. I'm gonna lose all my money. I'm gonna be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " homeless. No one's going to talk to me. I'm going to die. Right. But like, if you, if you play it out  " }, 

{ "sentence": " two natural steps, like, okay, I lose everything. What do I do? I would probably have a couch or floor  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that someone would lend me because at least socially I haven't been, I haven't fucked everyone I know.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I have that it's like, okay, so I would have some capacity to do that. Okay. Is there  " }, 

{ "sentence": " anything that I could do in the meantime in order to make money? Well, sure. I could drive Uber and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " strip. And I've already, you know, I've told this story before, but for me, that was genuinely my  " }, 

{ "sentence": " plan B. Cause I knew that I could probably make 70, 80 grand a year driving Uber. I could probably  " }, 

{ "sentence": " make 150 stripping, maybe 200 strip at the gay bars. The guys pay better. Uh, and then, uh, and you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " know, boom, I've got 280,000 a year. I could live on the floor and then I could restart again.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so that's because I don't have a lot of shame with that kind of stuff. That's like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that doesn't matter to me, but I think playing out the fear Layla says this and I love it,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but that fear is a mile wide and an inch deep. And so it looks like this ocean that you're going to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " step into and drown. But as soon as you step into it, you realize it was not that deep at all.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And you can keep walking through it. And, um, I just love that visual because a lot of times when  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's like, we have this anxiety around this big decision we have to make, if you actually take  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the step and realize that it's not death, you're not going to drown immediately. There's plenty  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of other steps you can take from there, even if you get a little wet.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Did I tell you my story about a friend who went through a cancellation and was worried  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it was a coward? Oh, like, uh, like a public cancellation thing?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. Okay.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So I went for dinner quite a while ago now with this guy that I was pretty interested in,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and he knew what I did and we went, sort of bumped into each other and,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what are you doing? Uh, let's go for dinner. And I knew about the situation that he'd been through,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but he didn't know that I knew. So I was like, tell me like, I'm, there's no pressure. And he was  " }, 

{ "sentence": " able to be unincumbent and basically went through like a, a tough cancellation where kind of the whole  " }, 

{ "sentence": " world came down to bear on him. And he was telling me this story. I was in a very interesting time as  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like being very reflective. And he said, my whole life, I'd been worried that I was a coward.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I was terrified that I was a coward, but I'd never been through a situation where I'd had to bring  " }, 

{ "sentence": " absolutely everything to bear on my life. And I'm a hard man. And I like to hang around with hard  " }, 

{ "sentence": " men and I like to shoot guns and do jujitsu and, and, and be around Navy SEALs and stuff like that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But I always had this fear in the back of my mind that I might secretly be a coward.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then he said the cancellation thing happened and it wasn't a very difficult one rep max. It  " }, 

{ "sentence": " wasn't a really hard CrossFit workout. It was something outside of his control.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And he used this term that I love. And he said, uh,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I could always hear my better self clearing his throat in the room next door.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I always wondered what would happen if I had to really, really wrangle everything,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if the whole world came crashing down on me and I wanted to work out whether or not I was a coward.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And he said, thankfully he kicked the door in and came through. But I just love that I could always  " }, 

{ "sentence": " hear my better self clearing his throat in the room next door, but he'd never been fully tested.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Done lots of hard things, a lot of acclaim, very successful, blah, blah, blah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But we all know that's your thing, right? Like, but I'll know about whether or not you've left  " }, 

{ "sentence": " something on the table. And, uh, yeah, he, there was always just 5% still in the tank  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when he was doing things, but how he felt about how invested he was. He always had to get out  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of jail free card in one way or another. And, uh, yeah, I love that. I'd fucking,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I could always hear my better self clearing his throat in the room next door.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Two things on that. So I think if we're,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if we're consolidating some of the points we were making earlier, the, but I'll know refrain,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think that a lot of the personal excellence comes down to making the, but I'll know more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " important than the, but everyone, what will everyone else think? Because the, I think the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " true test of whether you're a quote perfectionist or not is if everyone else in the room says it's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " exceptional and then you say, but I'll know it's not because I don't think it's exceptional yet.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " If you still break what everyone else believes is beautiful so that you can make the thing that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you make it the way you want it to make or make it the way you want it to be. I think that is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " probably like the, the truest test of whether or not you really do value your own opinion  " }, 

{ "sentence": " over those of other people's. And if you really want to be true to the quote, the art, whatever  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your art is, art, I'm using it as a generic term. It could be the career or the, even like the,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the, the financial projection that you're supposed to do at your company. Like there is a way you could do it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And do it absolutely excellent. And there's a way you could do it that you could phone it in and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " probably not get in trouble, but the things that you'd know, and then you'd be the type of person  " }, 

{ "sentence": " who always phones it in. And that to me is disgusting. And that would make me disgusted  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with me. And that is the thing that would make me want to peel my skin off because I would hate me.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I think that's why so many people do hate them because they do settle and they do  " }, 

{ "sentence": " make these things and they do know and still ignore it. And so they ignore the man in the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " other room who's clearing his throat and they shut the door and they lock it and they never let that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " guy in. And so they look like everyone else, they act like everyone else and they get what everyone else  " }, 

{ "sentence": " gets. America was built on the backs of men who smoked cigarettes, drove without seatbelts,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and had bacon for breakfast. If you miss your biohacking routine this morning,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're going to be okay. There's a time for leverage, but there's also a time for violence,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " which is just brute force. People get really obsessed with optimal, which is getting the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " most bang for your buck. But there's also maximizing, which is just getting the most bucks.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You lose more life trying to optimize everything than just living it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The stress of trying to be perfect is killing you more quickly than your imperfections.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think that's an ode to being willing to take huge amounts of imperfect action  " }, 

{ "sentence": " towards one goal and being willing to sacrifice other things for an extended period of time,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " despite the fact that other people will say they're making a sacrifice. Like when we enter seasons,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I call it, you know, the season of no, which is where you have extended duration where I say no  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to almost everything. And most people say that's unbalanced and they hurl that as though it's a bad  " }, 

{ "sentence": " thing. They're like, that's so unbalanced. You're like, yes, that's the point. Because if I had a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " balanced outcome, then I won't have the outsized return on this one thing. And so again, like there's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so many of these little insults that people will throw at you, like you're unbalanced, you changed you,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that they intend as insults. But if you actually don't take your society program response and say,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " oh, they mean to insult me. But if you actually think about what they're saying,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they're saying something that's true. And then we just need to be okay with that truth because that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " was the choice we made to begin with. And so I think about that a lot, which is like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " how many things do people tell me that they intend to insult me with that I can take as a compliment?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Didn't someone bump into Layla walking down the street?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. It happened so recently. So yeah, we're walking in the street, someone bumps into her.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I like, we don't always walk like side by side, because there's lots of people. So we like split  " }, 

{ "sentence": " up sometimes. Anyway, she comes back to me and she was like, guess what this guy just said? And I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " was like, what? And she was like, he called me a skinny bitch. And I was like, what? And she,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but she seemed so happy. And I was like, and I was like, like, I just kind of shook my head,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like, tell me more, like explain. And she was like, I mean, he said I was skinny.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I was like, this is the, this is the perfect example of him hurling an insult and her choosing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " not to be insulted.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Thank you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. Thanks.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " No, but really.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. Do you really mean it?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, they're like, I wonder how many times we've been insulted, even like in my younger days,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " where someone said something to me that like, if I had my current brain, I could have been like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you really mean it? Thanks, man. And yeah, like so unbalanced. I remember, I remember I took that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as such an insult for such a long period of time. Now, part of that was because when I was being  " }, 

{ "sentence": " brought up, balance was like one of the big frames of my household was like, you have to be balanced,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " which really just meant you have to be awesome at everything. But balance was the, was the word.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So being unbalanced was, was a term that was used as an insult. And so for so many years,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I wanted to be balanced. But then I was like, well, nothing great was ever achieved by people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " who tried to be great at all things. And so I was like, okay, I'm just not gonna, I'm not, I might  " }, 

{ "sentence": " not have a great relationship for a long period of time. I mean, there was like, a lot of people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " don't know this, but in the early days of our, uh, of our relationship, um, even when we were married,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I totally, so the first three years, um, I said, the business comes before our marriage.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So a lot of people don't know that. Um, and I was like, well, to me, it made sense. It was like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " most people break up over money. The business makes money. So the business feeds us and then we will be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " okay. And that was kind of my, my thinking around it. Um, and we eventually flipped that and said,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like, if we're good, the business will be fine. Uh, but it took three years to get there. Um,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but all that to say, like, I think having periods of imbalance and maybe to be fair, if we, if I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " hadn't had that priority at that time, maybe Jim Walsh wouldn't have been what it became.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I can't look back and say like, I should have done it different because it's really easy to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " say that now, but like, I might not be here to say that if I had been that way.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Oliver Berkman's got this great frame where he talks about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " choose in advance what you're going to suck at.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Oh yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And if you are a type, a go get a person who has what I called the curse of competence,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your options in life are restricted more by what you choose than what you can do.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You will feel disquiet when something that you used to be great at begins to slip because you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " focused your attention elsewhere. You used to be in really great shape. You said that one of your goals  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this year was to get a raise or to be able to buy your first house or to find a partner or to do  " }, 

{ "sentence": " whatever. Hey, guess what? If you're spending four or five nights a week going to places where you can maybe  " }, 

{ "sentence": " date or going out on dates or doing whatever, you're probably not going to have as much time  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to dedicate to the gym. If you want to get that raise or be able to save for your first  " }, 

{ "sentence": " house or whatever, you're going to have to work later, which maybe means that your friends are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " going to drop off. If you pick whatever the thing is, there is a price that you begin to pay.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And this cycle began for me so frequently toward the back end of my twenties, where I would dedicate  " }, 

{ "sentence": " myself to a thing, then something else would begin to slip. So I would then go, oh, I'll just, I'll,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'll just give a little bit. I'll just give a little bit to that. And it's not an additive system.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's multiplicative. It's not two plus like three, it's two times three. And that means that the more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that you would attend to the thing that you say that you're going to do, the more the gains accrue  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to you. And then you can still pivot back, but you need to periodize things. And this is, this is a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " frame that I wish even now, it's, it's still something that I struggle with realizing that now  " }, 

{ "sentence": " isn't forever. The thing that you're doing right now doesn't need to be forever. If you are coming  " }, 

{ "sentence": " out the back of the searching for the partner thing and you're like, hey, guess what? I gained 15 pounds.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. So, all right, well dedicate yourself for the next six months to going to the gym,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but this isn't the rest of your life. Right. And once that thing's done, oh, well,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " guess what? I'm back to, you know, 12% body fat. I feel great about myself. What's next? It's not  " }, 

{ "sentence": " forever. Yeah. It's just for now. Yes. We have a frame that we actually use a lot. I always think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about these things from a business context, but they end up retroactively applying to life. But when  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we're making big strategic decisions, we say like, which problems would we prefer?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so rather than talking about like the gains and what's the upside, if we have like, you know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " let's say we're going to make a big investment in software for this company, or we're going to make  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a big, you know, huge, a new service line, or we're going to just decide to develop a physical product,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right? I mean, I know you, you're like, you were literally on the just back half of a big decision  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like this yourself. It's like, okay, let's imagine what the problems are going to be. If we,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if we decide to do this new service category, well, some people are going to complain that they're not  " }, 

{ "sentence": " getting results from this thing. We're going to have a ton of, like, we might have some negative  " }, 

{ "sentence": " reviews in the short term that we're going to have to deal with. Like, let's look at what happens  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when one of our favorite customers tell us the fuck off. Like what, like what, like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " let's really sit in what each of these problems is. And then when we, when we spell out all of the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " problems and we don't even think about the upside and say, which of these problems do we prefer?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And which are we more equipped to deal with? Sometimes we have really amazing innovation.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And in my opinion, like really solid decision-making that comes afterwards that minimizes  " }, 

{ "sentence": " kind of the post-decision regret, because we also know what negatives would have come with the path  " }, 

{ "sentence": " unchosen because most, most times like our regrets come, come from the path unchosen because we imagine  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it only with the upside. We only think about, I think there's a, um, there's a, there's a book that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " where a girl lives many different versions of her life and midnight library. Yes. And the thing is,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is that there's these pieces of her life that she imagines are going to be amazing, but then she  " }, 

{ "sentence": " realizes her best friend's dead or all of a sudden she's pregnant and you're like, whoa, what happened?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so we don't take into account on the paths, not taken the things that we would have lost along the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " way. And so I think really good decision-making and also regret minimization is that when you make the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " decision, you think about the downsides too, and you remember what those downsides are. And for me,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that has been one of my strongest frames for like, I didn't decide to do that. We're all that. Oh,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yeah, those were a lot. I'm glad I, those are problems. I'm very happy. I don't have to deal with  " }, 

{ "sentence": " now. In other news, this episode is brought to you by Nomadic. You might've seen that I recently was  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on the road for a full 28 days using just hand luggage because hold luggage is a PSYOP meant to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " keep you poor and late. And almost everything is down to this backpack and the carry-on that I was  " }, 

{ "sentence": " using. This is their travel pack, their 20 liter travel pack. And honestly, it is the best backpack  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that I've ever found. It would take way longer than I've got to explain all of the different  " }, 

{ "sentence": " pieces of tech that are inside of this, but it basically allows you to pack so much more stuff  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with so much less fuss. And it's outstanding. They're beautifully designed, not over engineered,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and has a lifetime guarantee. So this is literally the final backpack that you will ever need to buy.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Also, you can return or exchange your bag for any reason within 30 days. So you can buy it,  " },

{ "sentence": " Thinking about the perils of over-optimization is something I brought up with Huberman last year.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I think a lot of people, I have a friend who's a very well-known DJ that told me he was falling out  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of love with DJing because he knew that it was damaging his sleep. And because he knew how important  " }, 

{ "sentence": " sleep was to performance that he'd kind of got him, the bar stool had been turned upside down a little  " }, 

{ "sentence": " bit. And the thing that he was trying to do was being sacrificed for the thing which is supposed to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " facilitate it. And that's where you lose more life trying to optimize everything than just living it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The stress of trying to be perfect is killing you more quickly than your imperfections.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " All right. So I'm glad we came back to optimization because there's obviously on the extreme,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there's guys like Brian Johnson with Blueprint who are trying to like live to 200 or live forever.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Um, and I, I, I respect that. I respect dedication to anything always. Um, and interestingly around,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I've always been a maximizer. So I've actually not really been an optimizer in my life. It's just like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as soon as I have an input output equation where it's like N equals X. And it's like, and if I want  " }, 

{ "sentence": " 10 X, I do 10 N. I'm like, great. Then can we do a thousand N? Like, I just want to do as much of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that as a human link possible. Um, but when we, like, I love competitors who like optimizing because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I always see it as a weakness because it's so easy to exploit. It's like, oh, you need your eight hours  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of sleep or you need your morning routine or you, if you don't have your supplements, you're just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " totally fucked. Or like, I didn't have my coffee this morning, so I can't function. Like I love to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " compete against people like that because they're so easy to break. It's fragile.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. And so what happens is the optimizations become superstition. Correct. And so my,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " my fear around, and I, and maybe I take a more extreme stance on this, but like, I've always wanted  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to be able to with an internet connection and a laptop and a fold out chair, go make money  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and always have that as my North star that anything else is extra. And I feel like I lose more quickly  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when I get into this optimization cycle around, cause I remember years ago, I, um, I bought one  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of those rings that tracks your sleep and I kept trying to like set sleep PRs and you can only get  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so high anyways. And then I started stressing more about not hitting sleep PRs that I was sleeping worse  " }, 

{ "sentence": " than when I wasn't tracking it. And so then I was like, well, fuck this thing. And I slept fine the next  " }, 

{ "sentence": " night. And so, um, obviously microcosm, I'm a big believer in tracking progress in general, but  " }, 

{ "sentence": " just the idea that we become so overly romantic around these things that sometimes you just have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to break shit. And sometimes you have to be violent. And sometimes when you're on your journey,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're not going to sleep much. And you're going to, you're going to like, there was a two year period  " }, 

{ "sentence": " where I did a turnarounds for gyms. I flew around the nation. I, every month I would do a new gym.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I ate out of gas stations and I ate gas station food and I gained weight during that period of time.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And it was for then and not forever. And I'm in shape now. And so whatever, who cares?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so like, I used to tell this when I was selling weight loss to people, I'd say like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " who cares if you get in shape for six weeks out of 80 years?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And like, right as they're about to sign up for a membership, I was like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you want to sign, and then this is how I would sell longer memberships, but like, it's also true.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, you want to sign up for the six weeks, but like, Susan, like, who cares if you lose 20  " }, 

{ "sentence": " pounds and you're still overweight six weeks from now, and then you gain it back the next six weeks,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and you're still the exact same weight for the rest of your life.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I just, I think the absolute dedication to maximization, so that it becomes a part of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your identity and your character has been one of the outsized returns that I've gotten in my life.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And just being absolutely willing to say, like, I'm pretty violent about this, but like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " list all the things that you aren't willing to give up for the dreams that you have.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And that is what the person who will beat you is willing to give up.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " There's a phenomenal blog post that talks about why guys aren't getting girlfriends.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And this is pre-modern mating crisis. So it's not, it's not to do with like imbalances on Tinder  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and tall girl problem and all that, all that stuff. It's a guy who thinks that the bare minimum is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " acceptable. So he talks about how I'm always on time. And, and, you know, I hold the door open and I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " say please and thank you. And I'm nice to my mom and the dude, I'll never forget it. There's this  " }, 

{ "sentence": " line in the blog post where the guy, who's like having this pretend dialogue with this imaginary  " }, 

{ "sentence": " person goes, so fucking what? There's a guy who does all of those things and he plays the guitar.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Well, it's like the, the song lyric, uh, baby, you, the whole package and you pay your taxes.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Um, yeah. I mean, I think also to the same degree, I mean, like I'm, I'm no mating,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " whatever expert, like no idea. I got married early, did all the things that, you know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " whatever you're not supposed to do. Um, but yeah. And yet  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you like, if you were true to you, like what's the most uncringed thing, right? Is you being you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm pretty sure that I turned away plenty of girls who were like, this guy's successful. He's in shape,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " uh, you know, decent looking, strikingly handsome. Um, but they'd meet me and they'd be like, what a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " fucking weirdo. But the thing is, is like, they like, and I remember I had, um, there were so many  " }, 

{ "sentence": " girls that I was like, you're pretty. And I, I, I just don't care at all.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I like, I just, I wanted someone who got my peculiarities who was like, not only like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " accepting of them, but just like down for it. And so I've, I walked through most of my, and to be fair,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as a side note, for anybody who like wants to quote, be exceptional, you're going to be different.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And people are going to think you're weird. And like, you might not get second dates, but real,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " real, you're not going to want the second date too, because they're not like you. Like when you get  " }, 

{ "sentence": " unplugged, you're like, oh, wow, everyone's a sheep. This is weird. And you just go on a zillion  " }, 

{ "sentence": " first dates to be like, yet another one, yet another one. And every once in a while, you see a glimmer  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in someone who they're like, oh, you think for yourself. Like you can make your own conclusions.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I remember when Leland and I went on our first date, we were, we were, we went at a frozen yogurt  " }, 

{ "sentence": " store. And so of course I'm like, so you know how they make their money here. Right. I was like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so these things weigh this, they charge this per ounce. And I was like, breaking this whole thing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " down. And she was like, oh yeah. And they do this and this. And I was like, wait, you see this too?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like you, it wasn't like, just like Alex was talking about the child out of the fucking sixth sense or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " whatever it is. I was so excited because normally I would just have to like talk, I would talk about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the stuff that at least I like to talk about. Cause then we'd pass the, not good dating strategy.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm just saying I wouldn't entertain myself. Yeah. But then she also like talk about this  " }, 

{ "sentence": " stuff and I was like, holy shit. Well, what's the alternative? The alternative is to find someone  " }, 

{ "sentence": " who falls in love with a role that you're playing. Right. That's the best that you can hope for.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Right. And then lock yourself in to a future of having to perform in a way that this person has  " }, 

{ "sentence": " become accustomed to. And there's nothing that can be more lonely than I can possibly imagine than  " }, 

{ "sentence": " pretending every single hour of every day that you're someone you're not. Do you know who Dr.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Robert Glover is? He wrote No More Mr. Nice Guy. No, but I like the title.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Had him on the podcast last week. This guy is a fucking boss. So cool. Like mid sixties or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " something now, huge goatee. He smoked cigarettes. Probably, probably. Rip starts. This office,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " by the way, is completely, it's like smoking enabled. We're in Vegas. And he had three  " }, 

{ "sentence": " essences of an attractive man. I think it's a really lovely frame. The essence of an attractive  " }, 

{ "sentence": " man. He's comfortable in his own skin. He knows where he's going. He has fun while he's going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there. Nailed. Nailed. So good. So good. But like that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " If you think about that as, okay, so if you're in like, even like an attractive man, whether you're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " married or not, like, I mean, on the flip side, it's like, do you want to be married and then  " }, 

{ "sentence": " choose to become unattractive? Well, no, of course not. And so it's like, if those are three ideals,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's like, you have, you have direction in your life. You're internally comfortable.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And the fun part is what makes you, I mean, partially attractive. And now, mind you,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you just have one of the three, you can, you will find a mate who's attractive. Like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you just know with all your fucking soul, you're going somewhere, people will want to rally behind  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you, even if you're not having fun. And even if you're not, he's got 10 kids, right? And even if  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're not that comfortable in your own skin, but you're like that guy, like, no matter what,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " he's going to fucking get there on the flip side. If you don't know where you're going and you don't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " even have much fun, but you're like, that guy is comfortable. Like, say what you want,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but that guy is good with him. That's an, like, that'll look like, if you just had one,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and if you just have a shitload of fun, you don't know where you're going and you're not  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that comfortable, like, you'll still have people. I'd probably prefer the first two to the third,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but, you know, but like, as ideals, like, fuck, very strong.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The only insults that hurt are the ones we believe. Next time someone insults you, remember,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they're going to die. Everyone will forget about them. And if no one will remember them,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " then you might as well forget about them now. They are irrelevant. Your dream, your actions,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your outcomes. So now you know what the inside of my head looks like.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I mean, I put almost everything immediately to death. And that's like, maybe it's a coping  " }, 

{ "sentence": " mechanism, maybe it's a perspective mechanism. But like, you want to hear, I was really strongly  " }, 

{ "sentence": " considering having a parody tweet profile of my own that I also run that no one would know that I run,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that is just like all my very, very controversial beliefs. But I'll throw a taster out now.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Murder is just picking when someone dies.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So it's like, if you hate someone, it's like, you can just look at them and be like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " oh, you're gonna die eventually. Like, and so like, the idea is like, in your mind,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you could murder every enemy you have, you just, just don't get to pick the time. But I just find  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's so such a like, murder only changes when not that someone's going to die. And so if you think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about like, retribution on someone's like, this person said this thing to me, I want to kill him.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, oh, no, you don't even have to, they'll die. They're gonna die already. Like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you don't even have to like, don't worry about it, they're gonna die. And so it sounds so silly.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But just connecting those two dots, I was like, wow, that's incredibly peace giving.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So like, why have a vendetta when life will take care of them for me?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I just like, you know, as a totally different frame, I was talking to somebody  " }, 

{ "sentence": " who has cancer in my life. And they were like, really concerned. They're like, this has a 95%  " }, 

{ "sentence": " mortality rate over the next five years. And, you know, me being me, I was like, well,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know, 70 year olds probably have a 60% mortality rate over the next five years anyways.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I was like, and life is 100% mortality rate. So, you know, worse, yes, but like, how much worse?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so like, they didn't think it was funny. But  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but just as it was intended to be comforting, it didn't succeed. But all that to say,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " these things that people cast on us, it's just whispers in the wind, right? Like, if we think that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " our whole meaning is so infinitesimal, the idea that someone else can influence our trajectory when  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they themselves will disappear and become irrelevant, seems so silly to me.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And they don't have our best interests at heart.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " No.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " They have the opposite of our best interests.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah, they're literally trying to destroy you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What about the only insults that hurt are the ones we believe? What about that?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Oh, yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Well, I because I like other people get offended with things. And then I've also had times where  " }, 

{ "sentence": " someone says something with the intention to insult and it doesn't. And I was like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " how can I get that to happen every time? And so it's the classic example of, you know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Chris, you have green hair, and then you would say, okay, whatever, sure, but you don't believe  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it. So it doesn't really matter. And so I think there's, there's a there's kind of a dual sided,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like lesson, at least for me in this is that when we are insulted, I try and pay attention to it,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because I think, okay, either there's something here that they're right about, and that I don't like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about myself, in which case, the response is to agree. And that's what's so frightening. And so  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's like, if someone so recently had someone, someone made something blasting me about,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I don't go home for the holidays, I made this whole, I made this video about it. And in the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " first five seconds of the video, of course, I'm like, if you love your family, fucking go home,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this is not this is for everybody else, right? But of course, no one actually watches that who makes  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that piece of content. And so they just went on this tirade about me. And I just said,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " God, I suck, period, as my comment. And because there's no, the stoic response to hate is to agree  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and one up. So level one is agree. So someone says, Alex, you're fucking it. And you're like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " believe me, if you knew half of it, you'd think more than that. Because it's the only way you can  " }, 

{ "sentence": " respond. And so my mental judo for these things, and I've just I try to now the good news for you and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I is that we get lots of practice, right? Every day, we have people hating on us. And so I get to,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I get to practice. So like, people, people meet you in real life, and they try to insult you,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're like, dude, I have so many reps on this. Like, oh, good. And so is this like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " can I want up their insult? Like, if someone insults me, it's like, dude, let me do believe  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you think that's good. Let me tell you how to really get me right. And so just the frame of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " agreement evaporates conflict. Yeah, that's your thing about most people are more interested in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're right. Yeah, Alex, you're an idiot. All of your business advice is terrible. I'd be like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're right. Now, where do we go from here? Right? Wasn't that fun? And so we talked about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like, because I like it human behavior a lot. But like, it's called it's a it's a extinguishing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " event. So like when you when you when you pull a slot machine, when when null is the outcome,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it nullifies. Agreement is the ultimate nullifier for insults. And I think that like, if the faster  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I reprogram that, so it's like, if you ever feel insulted, either, like, first, is it is it true?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, if you are insulted, you believe them? Okay, do I believe them? Because there's an element of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " truth? If there's an element of truth? Why am I insulting? I should agree with them. It's just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because we have some ego behind it of like, I'm going to be perceived a certain way. Or maybe because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's poking a hole, it's wedging into the inauthenticity that someone has brought into  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the light something which we thought we were able to keep in private.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " One of my other life goals is to die with no secrets.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Why?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because if we think about at least for me, if I think about authenticity,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to be seen as I truly am, then I would have no secrets. And I try, you know, I try really hard  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to not hold anything back content or otherwise. So that I don't need to have I don't want to have 100  " }, 

{ "sentence": " faces. Because if you always have something in the back room, that it means that to these people,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're this person, and this is in the back room, these people, you're this person in the back room.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But the fewer back rooms I have, the more everyone is in one room, and I can be just me. And that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " means that some people will hate me. And some people will like me. But they will actually like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or hate me, not the idea or some facet, like we were saying earlier, like when you're in a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " relationship, putting on the act and putting being the performer, they're not hating the idea of me,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they actually hate me. And at least there's some weirdness about like, at least that's true.  " },

{ "sentence": " to grow your business now, no matter what stage you're in. There's a lesson that I learned from  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Rob Henderson, which is like an interesting addition to what we're talking about here. And he asked the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " question, why do we feel insulted or why do our cheeks flush when somebody accuses us of something  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that we know that we haven't done? And the issue here is that we don't exist in a vacuum and we care  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about other people's interpretations of us. And the disinformation campaign, even if it's grounded in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " falsehood, can still negatively impact our status. So even if you know that this isn't true and all of the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the rest of it functionally to everybody that isn't you, or maybe many people that aren't you,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or maybe some people who are influential that aren't you, this can have the same impact as if it  " }, 

{ "sentence": " was true. So that the man being an island and I have faith in my own word, as soon as you start  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to build this out, there's a reason for trepidation there. I think, so I was trying to think about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like the, what are, what are counter examples? So like if someone attacks your character, right? So  " }, 

{ "sentence": " let's say someone comes out and says, Alex did some sort of sexual allegation or something like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that, that I know isn't true, whatever, but they say that now that's going to besmirch my reputation  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right now. I can't be like, you're right. And if you really knew, right? So I can't,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you knew the half of it. So like, so like those, those are the situations, right? So like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if someone just says like, you're, you know, you're full of shit or your business advice is bad or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " whatever, then that's one thing. But in those situations, the only counter that I have seen  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is to be louder. And so if someone increases the volume on something, I don't believe that you draw  " }, 

{ "sentence": " attention to that person. I actually, I've more or less not been in the, I'm going to address someone  " }, 

{ "sentence": " directly, but I may counter what this person says without addressing them and be 10 times bigger and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " louder about it as a way to counteract that. And so like, I had a bad reputation in college,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " which I, I've, I've shared some of that in my story before. Um, and the reputation was that I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " was a philanderer and was, you know, all about girls and whatever. And so I wanted to not have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the reputation. And so it wasn't like I was going to go talk to those girls and be like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I need you to recant your story. Um, I had to make my actions so much louder that I was no longer  " }, 

{ "sentence": " going to be that way for an extended period of time to counteract that thing. And so if we're thinking  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about like how to respond to people being shitty to you, if you believe what they say,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and it's true, agree and one up. If what they say is something that isn't true, but does besmirch your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " reputation, then you can only be respond by being louder with the truth. And I think that like, I,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think about these things, obviously we're in a position where we have to deal with this all the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " time. Um, as like almost playbooks for dealing with shots. Well, this is one of the things that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people got wrong about Dave Portnoy's cancellation. So Dave had sex with maybe two,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " two or three girls that sold the story. No, separately, uh, sold a story to the Atlantic.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think a pussy number, um, sold, sold a story to someone and they were, they were looking around,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and I think they're still going. I'm pretty sure that only a couple of months ago,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they tried to notify some pizza event that he was doing. Do you know that we're investigating him  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about that? And then he called them out. So what's happened is there's been million me too  " }, 

{ "sentence": " allegation things that have come across. People saw the way that Dave Portnoy responded. He came  " }, 

{ "sentence": " out of the fences absolutely swinging, like swinging so hard said, this is fucking bollocks. It's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " baseless. I think he maybe even somehow had video evidence or audio evidence of some kind,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " maybe internal CCTV cameras. Basically all of this stuff is dog shit. Yeah. People talk. Dave Portnoy  " }, 

{ "sentence": " didn't take any shit and, and, and he didn't back down and he didn't do an apology and he didn't do  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the rest. It's like, yeah, guess why? Because he didn't do it. Right. Because he wasn't in the wrong.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. If you are the guy that did do the thing. Yeah. You don't have that. That's a firm foundation.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What you're doing there is just creating this like cathedral of, of lies and dog shit on top  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of a sandcastle of lies and dog shit, which will then get found out and you'll get hit. You'll  " }, 

{ "sentence": " get slammed 10 times way, way, way harder. Rightfully so, to be fair.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That's the thing. So learning, okay, why did he do this particular tactic? Well,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " he ran that play because the basis of where he was at allowed him to.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Loud as shit about the truth. One, one thing that we talked about earlier with canceling,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and I have, um, so relatively contrary and views on canceling. Um, I genuinely believe  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that you cannot be canceled. You only are, you can only be canceled in two ways. You can be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " canceled if you choose to stop making content, stop being public or all means and methods and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " channels of communication that you do not control, remove you from it. So like, for example, uh,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there's Tate, right. And he had his, uh, like, he's not allowed to be on the platforms,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but they allow his content be on the platform. So has he been canceled? No, I would argue not.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And there's still other platforms. And he continues to make content.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So you only, so I, to me, this is actually really, um, uh, kind of heartwarming, uh,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " security feeling and I get warm and fuzzies around that reassuring. Thank you. Um, because it means  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that cancellation is, you have to agree to be canceled. No matter how bad, like, if you mess up.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The platform one. Yeah. Yeah. If they, if they lose, if they had AI face recognizing him and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " eliminated from the platform, he would be canceled. Like there's no method of communication outside of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in-person. He would have no leverage. Agreed. But barring that, if you continue to make content,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " no matter what you did, people will find out about you. More people will know it about you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and your message will get disseminated. And whether you choose to like recant something that you did,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or, you know, like right or wrong, apologize or do what Dave did and say like, this is complete  " }, 

{ "sentence": " bollocks. He's my little UK term. Uh, and just be even louder. You choose to be canceled. And I,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I like that because I like to have as many things under my control as I can.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. I've, I've been like thinking about the Streisand effect because everyone's always said,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know, cancellation makes people bigger. I think that is cope. I think it's massive cope.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I don't think that cancellation makes people bigger. Alex Jones, for instance, when he got,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " he got about as close to unpersoned, I think, as you can get very, very difficult. I wasn't seeing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for the last, whatever, five years, eight years, whenever he got taken off Twitter,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I wasn't seeing him on YouTube unless he was on somebody else's show. Uh, I wasn't seeing him  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on Instagram. I wasn't seeing him on Twitter. Uh, Steve will do it as a good example as well. Like he  " }, 

{ "sentence": " can't even be in the background of other people's YouTube videos and he's got shares in rumble and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " he's doing all of this other stuff, but still that's a pretty big unpersoning. And I think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's kind of cope to say, oh, but so many more people are searching them. Like the entire internet  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is built on convenience. Yeah. If you think that making it more inconvenient for someone to access  " }, 

{ "sentence": " someone makes them bigger, you are fundamentally forgetting human nature. Now, maybe in this, you know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " beautifully utilitarian, rational view of the world, the person that wants to see the thing,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they might go and get the thing, but it's like, Hey, guess what? Like TikTok's got an unlimited  " }, 

{ "sentence": " scroll and they're just going to keep going. And if they don't appear, they don't appear.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And to draw this into IRL for everyone who's like, okay, well that's might be convenient for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Alex Jones and whatnot. Like he can't, or he can, or can't be canceled, whatever. I think that at  " }, 

{ "sentence": " least for me, the through line on this is like, if you do some embarrassing thing, which happens,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we're human. The only way it compounds into being like a much bigger problem is if you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " become a recluse, you choose to not go out. You choose to not, you choose to disassociate with  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everyone else. Like you choose to agree to the terms that the people around you are telling you,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you have to agree to. And that's where I think you can say, no.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Justin, he's got this idea. He told me this story. I think it was like VidCon or VidSummit 2012.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And Destiny's sprayed it around a bit in his career. And he was at this huge YouTuber convention  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and his ex-girlfriend or something got access to his Twitter account and leaked his dick pics  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on his Twitter while he's at this VidSummit thing, surrounded by his peers. So he's trending.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So it's not only, oh my God, look what's happening on the internet. It's, oh my God,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the internet has now become real life and it's in front of me and there's thousands and thousands  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of people and they all know what's going on. And you know, Finding Nemo, just keep swimming,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " just keep swimming from Dory. His is just keep streaming. He says,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everybody only remembers your last four streams. So sure enough, he went on first stream,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " just the chat is lit up, taking the piss out of him and like, here it is. Second,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " second one, still lots and lots and lots of jokes. Third one, like a few less. And then  " }, 

{ "sentence": " fourth one is pretty much gone. Yeah. After four streams-  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's not funny anymore, we've all heard it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. So true Geordie got, it's like a British UK YouTuber, big guy. And a few years ago,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " his DMs got leaked from his verified Instagram account saying some like pretty dirty sex stuff  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to a girl. And-  " }, 

{ "sentence": " She was of age?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " She was of age. There was no, it was like, it was kind of, I guess it was intimate and like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " embarrassing or whatever for him, but he, uh, he was silent, pretty much silent for five days  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and then got probably the best roast comedian in the UK to come on and annihilate him for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " 20 minutes in a video and put it out on his own YouTube channel. And it's that B-Rabbit thing.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Tell these people something that they don't already know about me. Like what joke are you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " going to make that Steven tries? Like literally the most vicious, funny, sardonic UK roast person  " }, 

{ "sentence": " hasn't already said, and it showed that he could laugh at himself.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Dude, this is the, uh, so this is the take what they say, one-up them, right? And so like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm going to- Take what they say, find a person who is professional at one-upping them  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and then bring them in and then publish it to your million person YouTube channel.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yes. Like we, um, we, so we actually teach this from a customer service. I know I'm going,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " totally cross pollination here, but we call it, there's, there can only be one person in the angry  " }, 

{ "sentence": " boat. And so customer comes in, they're shouting. And I learned this from my, like one of my earliest  " }, 

{ "sentence": " business mentors. I worked at a fur coat dealer. Uh, so like brushing, you know, furs, it's a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " glorious job. Um, I was 18, it was the summer. And so this lady walks in and I was at the retail  " }, 

{ "sentence": " shop, which normally I was in the warehouse where the peasants were. And, uh, and so this lady comes in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and she's making a whole mess of noise. And the guy walks towards me, cause the owner,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and he, I see him like roll his eyes. And then he's, he turns, turns the corner to go where she  " }, 

{ "sentence": " can see him. He, like his face turns into a smile. And then he's like, he's like, Mrs. Robinson. And  " }, 

{ "sentence": " then he just goes into rage mode. And I was like, whoa, what's happening? And he was like, wait,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there was a button missing on your jacket. He's like, give me that jacket. He like pulls out. He's like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " who sold this to you? Who let you walk? He said, did anyone see you in this? And, and he was like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " tell me their names right now. I'm going to get them. They're going to be out of here. Like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we're going to end, like, we're going to get, terminate their employment. We're going to make  " }, 

{ "sentence": " sure that they never eat again, all this stuff, whatever. And she, all of a sudden she back,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " she was like, oh no, no, you know, no one saw me in it. I just got, I just saw it when I got home.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " If you guys could just, of course, we're going to fix it of like, no question whatsoever. And so of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " course she, he takes the ticket, she leaves, he comes to the back and he just looked at me and he was like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " only one person can be in the angry boat. And I, and I, it was a lesson that has stuck with me in like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and so in this, in this instance, everyone is angry at you. And so the only thing you,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " cause people are contrarian by nature, all you can do is be angrier than them at whatever it is.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so like getting the comedian to like, oh, you think he insulted me? Like, here's a picture  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of my cold shriveled dick after a nice cold, after my polar plunge. You want to see like, so it's just,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's like, can you do that? And it's just leaning into what feels unnatural and uncomfortable,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but it's the only way to respond.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You cannot wish for a strong character and an easy life. Each is the price of the other.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What if what you're going through isn't hard? What if you're just sensitive?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think that most of us can look back on our lives to 10 years ago and think about the problems that we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " were dealing with then. And think about how much of a pittance and how small those problems were  " }, 

{ "sentence": " compared to the problems that we deal with today. At least that's how I probably feel. Maybe you feel the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " same way. And so I then think, okay, well, if I feel that way about the problems that I had 10 years  " }, 

{ "sentence": " ago, then 10 years from now, Alex will look back at the problems that I'm dealing with today and feel  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the same way. And so if he feels that way, then about the problems that I have now, then the only  " }, 

{ "sentence": " difference is the perspective that he has that I don't have. And so I might just be a sensitive  " }, 

{ "sentence": " little pansy and maybe these aren't problems at all. Maybe these are just facts of life and I need  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to habituate to them. Cause I remember my first lawsuit, right? Cause it's like, when you're in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " business long enough, you make enough money, you're just going to get sued. It is what it is.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I was listening to Elon Musk talk about this. And at any given time, Tesla has hundreds of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " lawsuits at any, like just, they have massive departments of legal just for all the different  " }, 

{ "sentence": " things that are going on. And it was thinking that a requisite for success is a problem. Like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you cannot become the wealthiest man in the world and not get sued. Like getting sued is a,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is an indicator that you're actually is a, is a requisite for being there. There's no,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " no person has been there without this. And so reframing what I used to consider a problem as a,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as a point of evidence that I am on the path that I originally chose.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I remember the first time that I ever tried to incline chest press, 20 kilos. And as I got it up,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this is in the center for sporting excellence in Newcastle gym. And as I got it up there,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I didn't have the tricep strength to be able to keep it. And I watched this thing slowly come down  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and it just landed on my nose. And I like sort of bailed it, bailed it out off my nose.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And now it's not even, it's not even the warmup to the warmup to the warmup set.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So the problem is that we don't have very good memory. We don't have theory of mind for ourselves,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for a previous version of ourselves. I've always thought that it would be such an amazing tool.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Maybe Neuralink can do it at some point in future. You know how people want to go back in time and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they want to see a different place. I would love to go back in time in my own mind and remember the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " texture of my own existence and what were the things that I thought about. I've told this story  " }, 

{ "sentence": " before, but it's pretty illustrative. Day one is a journal that you can use for your phone. It's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " pretty good. And for me, it's big shit. It's like big things are happening. If I open day one,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " some fucking shit's going down and breakups and illnesses and being worried about people dying  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or whatever the fuck. I once opened it to write down that the MC in room two, the R and B room  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of our Saturday night club night had told me that he was leaving to go to a competitor event 15 miles  " }, 

{ "sentence": " away. And I remember thinking that it was so salient to me that it deserved to go in along  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with breakups and do I go on this reality TV show or do I not? Because I was adamant that that would be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the beginning of the end because the only reason the Asian SOC, the Asian society came down was because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they liked this particular MC. And if he went, then Asian SOC would stop coming. And if Asian SOC  " }, 

{ "sentence": " stopped coming, then that would mean this. And then the whole business would go and I'd be dead.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But I don't think that anymore. And there was one, there was one time where I hadn't worked our  " }, 

{ "sentence": " events for quite a while. And a DJ that used to work for us came through and he thought that he'd  " }, 

{ "sentence": " wind me up by saying three minutes before we opened that something was up with one of the CDJs.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " If something's up with one of the CDJs a couple of minutes before you open, things are bad because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there's usually not a spare and it means that the night's going to be delayed or whatever. And there was  " }, 

{ "sentence": " lots of people outside waiting to come in or whatever it might be. And he was expecting a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " response from a previous version of me, which would have been the one that would have gone  " }, 

{ "sentence": " into day one and typed about the fact that the CDJ hadn't worked. And I just said,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " oh, okay, well, I don't know, we'll fix it. And he called out, broke the fourth wall and said,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like, it's not broken at all. Like, I just thought that I'd wind you up, but you didn't play the game.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm like, oh, right. It's the, like, you've grown or you've changed thing.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. He was juke the, don't juke, don't punk the game.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yes. Don't punk the game.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think the point is to always punk the game as many times as you possibly can,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " especially if you're the one getting the game played on you by yourself.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What's your framework for quitting things and moving on to something new?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " How do you know when you're quitting because you're being a bitch?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And how do you know that you're moving on from something that's no longer worthwhile?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Man. So there's a, there's a handful of questions that I think everyone faces that,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you never know the right answer to. And so it's like, how much is the right amount to invest versus  " }, 

{ "sentence": " consume is one of those answers. Like if you invest, if you consume nothing and you invest  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everything into it tomorrow, you end up with a life where you enjoyed nothing. And then you have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a big pile of shit.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Delayed gratification and the extreme results and no gratification.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Right. And so like there, these are, these are rather than either ors, they're continuums.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so to be managed more than problems to be solved. And so I think just from a decision-making  " }, 

{ "sentence": " framework, that's number one. Number two is so with regards to this one, which is, do you push  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or do you pivot? Which is how I, how I frame this question. Pushing like, do I push through  " }, 

{ "sentence": " whatever this hardness is? And there's like something that's in sight that I think I can go to,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or there are fundamental things that have changed that make my original hypothesis wrong.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I'm, I'm, I'm telling the secret right now. But for me, I won't quit if no new information  " }, 

{ "sentence": " has come to light. And so if I say, I'm going to do this based on these assumptions,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if those assumptions have, have still held, then it's a push situation. If there's new data  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's come to light that changes the nature of why I'm pushing or the outcome for what I'm going to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " get from pushing or the way that I'm pushing is incorrect, then I would quote quit. But quitting  " }, 

{ "sentence": " has a lot of, um, heavy terminology in, you know, I'd say personal motivation, masturbation.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Pivots much softer, right? Because I think that everything is a pivot except for stopping.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I think even reframing, like language matters a lot and I care a lot about language.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so like nothing is quitting unless you stop. And if you continue to pivot and you continue to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " push either of those are activity. And so you will stumble upon something that does work in which case  " }, 

{ "sentence": " do more of it. Um, and so that has always been my frame, but it's, I have an initial assumption  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or series of assumptions for a desired thing. So let's say I want to, I want to build my social  " }, 

{ "sentence": " media brand. I say, okay, I believe that if I make, you know, content about things that no one  " }, 

{ "sentence": " else can make content about that is more higher level business stuff than is out there because most  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of the YouTubers are YouTubers, not business people, there will be an audience for that. And in the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " beginning I will have fewer people who follow it. But if I make really good stuff over time,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " eventually people will tell people and I will get better at making content and that will grow.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So if I'm at year two and, and it's, and the thing is, is like, do I have leading indicators?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so like, even in business stuff, like we'd, I don't need the outcome, but are there leading  " }, 

{ "sentence": " indicators that are telling me that this I'm on the right path. And so identifying ahead of time,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " just like we have a problems that we identify, like, okay, if we succeed, like people are gonna  " }, 

{ "sentence": " recognize you in the street, you're not gonna be able to go out as much or like all these are,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " these are problems I don't have to deal with. Cool. I'm willing to pay for those. But what are the,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what are the things along the way that will tell me that even though I haven't achieved Mr.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " B stem that I'm on the right path. And so I think having those little indicators allow you to keep  " }, 

{ "sentence": " taking steps towards the ultimate thing and continue to push. I mean, I have a different  " }, 

{ "sentence": " tweet, which is that the world belongs to those who can continue to work without seeing the result  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of their work, continue to do without seeing the result of their doing. And it's really the person  " }, 

{ "sentence": " who can do that for the longest period of time. And that's usually because they're still getting  " }, 

{ "sentence": " leading indicators. It's just that it's amounting to a much bigger mountain. And so like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you want to do big shit, it takes a way longer period of time, because the easy shit,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the little hills, everyone conquers really quickly. I'm on time. I say please and thank  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you. It's like so fucking what? And so like, if you want to do something that most people can't do,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " literally just extend the time horizon on the things that most people can't weather.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, there's so much opportunity on the other side of being willing to persist for an extended  " }, 

{ "sentence": " period of time on the correct path without getting positive reinforcement from your environment.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And the longer you can stick with something without that positive feedback loop in terms of the big  " }, 

{ "sentence": " external thing, the easier the opportunities are because so few people can pursue them.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " In James Clear's Atomic Habits, I think he interviews maybe the Chinese weightlifting team's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " head coach. And he asked, what is the difference between the absolute elite world champions  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and the ones that simply qualify? And the coach said, the absolute elite are the ones who can continue  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to come in every single day without getting bored. That was it. And Matt Fraser talks about it as well,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " where he says that doing an hour and a half of monostructural work on the rower, you've got to do zone  " }, 

{ "sentence": " two. Hey, guess what? You don't even get the benefit of feeling like you worked that hard.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. You just get to kind of whatever, like 24 strokes a minute or something like slow zone two,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " whatever the thing is. But no one's fired up for that. He said, people make a mistake in believing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that I'm fired up to go and do that session. I'm not fired up to go and do that session.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I just go and do that session.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " We were saying, so there's a lot of people say like, do the work. And in gym launch and it's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " continued into our stuff today, but do the boring work is what we call it. And boring is what make  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you rich. Boring, the boring activities. It's the, it's the double checking the emails. It's writing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the followup sequence that you really don't feel like writing. And honestly, just getting it done will  " }, 

{ "sentence": " make you significantly more money than not getting it done. And so it's like, it's, it's, it's falling  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with a lead from a month ago and just being like, Hey, by the way, are you still interested in that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " thing? It's the stuff that you don't want to do. Like, no, one's like, I can't wait to follow  " }, 

{ "sentence": " up with these leads that haven't responded to the last two text messages I sent. But if you respond,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you follow up to everybody, you will make more sales.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Presuming that it's an effective strategy because there are ways that you can continue to chug away  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and do a thing with no positive reinforcement, but Hey, guess what? That's the direction that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're supposed to be going in and you're walking over there.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. Well, that's a push and pivot, right? Like if, if, if no one responds,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " then I would say I have zero leading indicators, but if you have enough response rates, then it,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " then it's worth the toil. Um, but I, I, I, so, I mean, Michael Phelps talks about this too,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with, uh, with swimming, like just laps after laps after like, he doesn't even have the variety of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like different moves or different, like it's just laps, just sheer volume of work. And, um,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I call it the rocky cut scene and almost every successful person that I have ever encountered  " }, 

{ "sentence": " has gone through not a month or a year, but many years of doing work without reward,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " where they have to do things that other people find boring. And they have to sacrifice things  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that everyone finds interesting that most people want to do during that entire season of their life.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And they basically sacrifice a season of other things that they would prefer to do  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to do stuff that they would not prefer to do because of the one thing they want most. And  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's the rocky cut scene. And instead of lasting five minutes, it just usually lasts five or 10 years.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You're going to lose sleep. You'll doubt whether it'll work. You'll stress to make ends meet.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You won't finish your to-do list. You'll wonder whether you made the right call and have no way to know  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for yours. This is what hard feels like. And that's okay. Everything worth doing is hard. And the more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " worth doing it is, the harder it is, the greater the payoff, the greater the hardship. If it's hard,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " good. It means no one else will do it. More for you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think a lot of entrepreneurship and even personal growth is training yourself  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on how you respond to hard.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because in the early days, hard was, ooh, stop. This isn't good. I should, I should,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this is a warning sign. This is a red flag. I should slow down or I should stop, you know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I should pivot. But the more I think about it as a competitive landscape, as I'm clear on what this  " }, 

{ "sentence": " path is supposed to look like. And these rocks and these dragons are things that I'm going to have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to slay along the way to get the princess or get the treasure.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I get happier about the harder it is because I know that no one else will follow.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's a selection effect.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I think if you can, if you can shift from this is hard to no one else will be able to do this,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " then it's, it flips from being this thing that you're like, oh, poor me to, oh, poor everyone  " }, 

{ "sentence": " else who's going to have to fucking try. Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I think that is so much more motivating as a frame for the exact same circumstance.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. That's awesome. I was thinking a lot about the lonely chapter that we talked about the last  " }, 

{ "sentence": " time. That was the best, most powerful idea I think that we came up with. And if you see  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there basically being no shortcuts toward getting the thing that you want, there are ways to be more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and less efficient. And there are ways to do things with more and less of a positive disposition,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " which can actually make the journey feel an awful lot easier. But ultimately, if you assume that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " largely everyone needs to go through the same challenges that you're going through,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " every single difficult thing that you do is kind of like a massive wall that you need to get over.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And you go, wow, fuck, I'm so glad that I've got over that wall. And think about how many people are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " going to be selected out. It's like the Hunger Games, you know, think about how many other people are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " going to fall at that wall there. People only root for people who don't need it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like the amount of times when I was on my lonely path, where I was too different from the friends that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I had, but not successful enough to be friends with the people that I wanted to be friends with.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That's when that's when you want people to root for you. That's when you want people to support you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Once you've already won, people are like, he's amazing. He's so good. But like, that's the time  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when you need it the least. And so you always have to be the person who roots for you before everyone else  " }, 

{ "sentence": " does. And it's usually a single clap in the auditorium for a very long period of time. It is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a slow clap. That's just you rooting for you. And that visual, I think, is one that you can kind of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " take because it is. People struggle to do things alone. And the path of the exceptional person  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is one of an exception, which means that you are not with other people. And rather than fighting that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or bemoaning it, see it as an indicator that you're on the right path. Because if everyone else were  " }, 

{ "sentence": " cheering you on, then it means you're not in the right place. Because it means you're just like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everyone else and that's not where you want to be. It's an interesting paradox that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the energy it requires to start doing something is way more than the energy required to continue  " }, 

{ "sentence": " doing the thing. And that the beginning of doing anything results in the lowest amount of reward,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " both internal and external, than when you've been doing it for ages. So I think about this a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " lot with the show that there was this stat that Spotify told us, 85% of the listeners of this show  " }, 

{ "sentence": " found us in 2023. And I thought at the end of 2022, remembering at that point, I'd been on Rogan,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we were at like 650K, we've been doing 550, 600 episodes deep. I've got it, I've done the thing.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like this is me doing, if this isn't fucking doing the thing, I've moved to Austin, Texas,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I've got an 01 visa, I've got like all the rest of this stuff. Jordan Peterson's been on twice,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you've been on. And yet, the, what? Everything up until that point is...  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Two months of growth.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. I mean, we made, we made more money, just from a revenue perspective, we made more money  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and more subs in one month, December of last year than we did in the entire first three and a half  " }, 

{ "sentence": " years of the show. So it's this odd paradox. And one of the things that you need to ensure,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I've had this idea about protect your passion at all costs, because if you, if you begin to hate  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the thing that you do, you negatively change your trajectory. And that means that at the time when  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you can benefit the most by every single unit of work, which is the later that you go, presuming  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that you continue to hit that upward trajectory, if you've completely killed any passion or desire to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " do the work in the early stages, because you've, you've not protected it appropriately. That can be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " by focusing on the wrong things, by not rewarding yourself, by not building it with people that care  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about you, by, you know, just not, not celebrating when you hit milestones, all of the things that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " actually help to keep you going. By being a character.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " By the time you get to the stage where each unit of effort allows you to gain a thousand or a million  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of each of the things that it would have done at the very beginning, you've inverted the,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like the passion equation takes way more energy to start a thing than to continue doing a thing.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And yet in the beginning, the rewards are way lower than they are at the end. But if you don't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " protect your passion, your motivation is at its lowest when you are at your highest amount of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " efficiency in terms of returning your time put in. I think a hopeful message that anyone can think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about who's about who's in that hard period or in that start period is that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it won't get harder. Like this is the hardest part. And so if you can just make it through this,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everything else is downhill. It's not that the things that you're, the dragons are going to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " slay, aren't going to get bigger. They are, but you become so much more equipped to slay them back.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And you have so many more allies. You have people in the stands cheering for you. You have the audience,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you have all of these other things that are behind you, but in the beginning, it's just you with a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " stick against a bear. And arguably that fight is a harder fight to win than beating a dragon when you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have a nuclear bomb and six nations behind you. And so it's not even like the, the size of the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " hardship. It's just also the resources and how few of them you have and how so much of the beginning  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is literally burning the one thing you have, which is time because you have no leverage.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You don't have the money to pay other people to help you. You don't have the resources to go  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like get someone to, to no one can learn it for you. It's like, there's a lot of the things that,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that we care about a lot. Like no one can work out for you. It doesn't matter how much money you have.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " No one can learn skills for you. And so in the early days, like it feels so painful. Cause you're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like, you look around to see who can help you. And then you're like, it's me again. And I think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " getting comfortable with the idea that each of these things kind of like slumdog millionaire,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you've seen that movie where he, I'll give you the TLDR, he goes through his entire life of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " randomness and he gets on the, who wants to be a millionaire version in India. And it has 12  " }, 

{ "sentence": " questions to make a million dollars. And from only 12 random experiences in his life that seemed  " }, 

{ "sentence": " meaningless at the time, was he able to answer all of the questions and then ultimately when  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the skills that you develop along the way, like Steve jobs, learning calligraphy that then became  " }, 

{ "sentence": " apple fonts that, you know, transformed how we type those early days, that little trench winning  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in the weeds oftentimes gives you these huge advantages later on because you have more context  " }, 

{ "sentence": " than anyone else. And so rather than lament them and hate the fact that you're going through it,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " remembering that these will be arrows that you put in the quiver that you're going to be using to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " slay the future, bigger dragons. And so  " }, 

{ "sentence": " expecting it to be easy is what makes it much harder than it ever is.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I've always loved earning my stripes with the things that I've done, whether it was with nightlife or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " running the podcast or doing whatever. And I think there's like a degree of nobility to it,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but functionally that's kind of, that's just like, it's a nothing. Like what's the nobility? But I think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the reason that you can feel noble about it and the reason that it gives you a positive reward is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know that you understand every single inch of the things and that if you want to hold a conversation,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we went out for dinner with our new CFO and accounts people on Saturday and they said,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you ask a lot of questions. Most people don't ask very many questions. And I also don't care at all  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about accounts really. Like I'm not doing this for money, but they said, you ask a lot of questions.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I said, well, I don't ever really want to walk into a room and not be able to hold my own,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " at least just competently, if it's to do with something that I care about. And the same thing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " goes for this. Like I understood, I started to learn about focal lengths and frame rates and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " negative fill, reverse contrast lighting. And then sure enough, two years after we started doing it,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a bunch of different, I sent you the Instagram thing, like this really awesome  " }, 

{ "sentence": " film Instagram that I've been following for ages, picked us up for what we were doing and gave us  " }, 

{ "sentence": " props independent of the talky thing, which is fundamentally what we're here for.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And we created this entire new industry of like cinematic podcasting, which was recognized by,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as far as I'm aware, like the best cinematic, it's called film lights at film lights. People  " }, 

{ "sentence": " can go and see it on Instagram, like the best decoder and analyzer of cinematography. And two  " }, 

{ "sentence": " years ago, when we started, I remember thinking, fuck, like, I love the way that they've broken down  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what happens in Ad Astra. Oh my God, the whole thing was shot on 35 million. Each different scene's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " got two pairings of colors and stuff like that. And then, but the reason that we were able to get  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there, at least in some part is I can have a conversation with people. So each of the things that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you do when you not only win in the weeds, but live in the weeds, then allows you downstream from  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that to see the things that other people aren't seeing. There's a quote that I love from Dr.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Cashew. I'll probably butcher it, but experts have more ways to win than beginners do. And so  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if an expert goes into any setting that they're expert in, they have so many faster feedback loops  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that reward them in the moment before the ultimate outcome. So if you're a master video editor,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there's so many things that you can do that while editing, you make one change and then it looks right.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You have a positive feedback loop. And so I think when you're on the start path,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you can't look at the outcome is the only positive because you will never make it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so the positive frame that I've always used is sure you can have the external ones of like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I like thinking about my first videos had like 13 views. And I'm like, well, if I had an audience  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of 13 people, I used to spend years pitching, you know, weight loss stuff to rooms of 13. And that was  " }, 

{ "sentence": " fine. And so thinking about that way was helpful. But the, the most helpful frame was thinking  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about who I was becoming as the asset that I was building. So in real time, whenever I finished  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a long day's work, I was becoming more like the type of person who could work for five years without  " }, 

{ "sentence": " reward. And that would be part of the story I would someday tell. And so some of the biggest reinforcers  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I've had in my life has been future casting the story that I would tell about the shitty period that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I was in. Like, I remember when I was sleeping on the floor at my gym, because I didn't have enough  " }, 

{ "sentence": " money for two rents. And I was like, I will fucking tell this story. And when I lost everything for the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " first time, I like, I have the screenshot of the bank account. Like when I show it, people are like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " oh, look, there's that thing. But they forget that there was a person who screenshotted it to be like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this won't fucking happen again. And I think having a larger narrative of where you're ultimately  " }, 

{ "sentence": " going, one gives you the vision of where you're like the like, knows where he's going. But  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it allows the dragons that you have to slay along the way, the hard things that you have to overcome  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to feed into the larger narrative of who, of the story that you'll someday tell. And so like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " no one ever tells stories about the hero who made it all happen immediately and had no hardships. No  " }, 

{ "sentence": " one cares, right? Like, okay, you were born to a billionaire. Is there a story there? Not really.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But everyone loves the story because we can see ourselves in the character and how much we hope to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " be like them. And it's the being like them, not the having what they have that we usually like.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so reframing ourselves as the hero of that narrative in my harder times was what really got  " }, 

{ "sentence": " me through that and thinking, I will tell this story someday.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Have you heard Rogan talk about the be the hero of your own story thing?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Oh, dude, it's as old now. I think this is maybe, maybe even 10 years old, maybe 10 years old.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Um, and he's in one of his old, he's in the LA podcast studio and he says,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " imagine that you're in a movie and imagine the movie begins now and you're the hero of the movie.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. What would that guy do? Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What would that guy do right now? Yeah. Because you are.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I just got into business. Um, so actually I just made the investment in school. Um,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and I was talking to Sam, the founder and I said, what sim, Sam, sim, what sim, sim. That's why he  " }, 

{ "sentence": " says his. Oh yeah. Um, and I was, and I was talking to him and I said, I want to give you the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " single easiest razor to predict my behavior. And I said, whatever will be the most epic story  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is the thing that I will most likely do. And so oftentimes the most epic story is not the shortest  " }, 

{ "sentence": " outcome to victory. It's the long saga that results in this big thing later, eventually.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I was like, if you ever want to know, if you're like, I'm not sure what he's going to do  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in this situation, just wonder what the most epic story to tell would be. And that's usually what I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " will do. And I don't know if that's self-aggrandizing, but that's, that's genuinely  " }, 

{ "sentence": " my razor for even making the, just like the big decisions about, okay, I'm going to sell gym launch.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm going to, I'm going to marry Layla. I'm going to slum it and live at the gym. I'm going to fly  " }, 

{ "sentence": " around and do turnarounds. I'm going to start this whole idea of a media company that just gives  " }, 

{ "sentence": " exclusively, but like, how do it, like, how do I put all these together? It's like, well, what would  " }, 

{ "sentence": " be the most epic story? And I thought of this idea of just like, when I think about who that story I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " want to tell is, is this billionaire that documented the entire thing the whole way and just gave,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because I always thought, I was like, I wish that Elon Musk and, and Warren Buffett and all  " }, 

{ "sentence": " these guys would have liked, and Jeff Bezos, like, would have just like, I would love to have seen  " }, 

{ "sentence": " 1997 Amazon content. And a lot of the content in terms of like, it it's getting five views.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, it's okay, because when we make it, they're going to come back and watch this.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So I don't need them to watch it today. I want them to know that it's here when I do.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I think that got me out of the loop of it. I have to win right now. And then every one of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " them is just dropping a kernel or a breadcrum for future me to refer back to.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Until you win, effort always goes unnoticed. Get used to it. No one roots for you until  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everyone roots for you. That's just how it works.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. Yeah. People only root for those who don't need to be rooted for.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's strange to think about how mimetic and fallible everyone, me and you, everybody  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's listening to this is. There's stuff that I've said on this podcast for like six years,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " seven years, since the first time that I ever said it, seven years. And it's only been within  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the last 18 months that it's gone viral. It's the same sentence, the exact same sentence,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " said into the same microphone, slightly nicer lighting. And in some ways it's reassuring,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because you go, I fucking knew that was right. I knew that thing that I was saying was right.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I kept saying it until people realized that it was right.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Right. Another part of it is the medium matters more than the message in many ways. The frame  " }, 

{ "sentence": " matters more than the picture. Totally.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I would say that the medium, the medium and the message are inextricably linked.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like if Elon Musk tweets, I'm taking a shit, it will get a zillion shares because he's the richest  " }, 

{ "sentence": " man on earth and has done more entrepreneurial endeavors that have pushed humanity, I think more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " than anyone else at this point. And so like, you can't separate the message from the messenger.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I remember when I was in middle school, I learned this lesson where I was in Spanish class  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and there was, you know, there was the class clown or whatever. And I was like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I want people to laugh at my jokes. And so I made a joke that was a joke that that guy probably would  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have made. And it was a self-deprecating joke. Um, but the thing is, is that like that guy was  " }, 

{ "sentence": " kind of a bum and like him making self-deprecating jokes made sense because of the context of who he  " }, 

{ "sentence": " was. But I was a straight A student who was really good at sports and no one thought it was funny.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And fast forward, you know, 10 years, there was a joke that I had in our fraternity, which is,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there's nothing funny about an in-shape body. And so like the, the, I agree with you in that the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " message, the, the medium of the message matters. And so people won't root for you because we use  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the, the delivery mechanism usually as a filter for whether we should even trust the source.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I tell the story of the, the teacher who's talking about dollar cost averaging into the SMP  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and giving investing advice. Like they might be like, man, like I give better investing advice than  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Warren Buffett does. Like he's saying the same thing as me. It's like, and you know what,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're probably right. The only problem is you didn't build Berkshire Hathaway.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so no one gives a shit. And so the thing is, is that we use someone's evidence and authority  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as a filter for how little we need to process the information. Because if you're listening to a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " teacher, you have to then think, okay, can I separate the message from the person? Can I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " independently analyze this and say, is it good? Is it bad? If Warren Buffett says you should buy this,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you don't need to analyze. You figure he knows more than me. He has more perspective and I will just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " take it as fact. And so it's actually lazy consumption on behalf of everyone else that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " gives authority so much resonance and so much shareability because they're also protected.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because if you share something, Elon says you're protected by Elon and his brand.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so the hard work is getting to the point where you have the evidence  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that people are willing to feel safe agreeing with you. And the only way for them to feel safe agreeing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with you is for you to disagree with them for a very long period of time until you prove that you're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right. Rory Sutherland's got an idea where he says, no one gets fired for hiring KPMG.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. Such a good line.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And it's true. People would sooner fail by following a blueprint that's been done before  " }, 

{ "sentence": " than risk succeeding by trying something new. Because if you try the new thing,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " any failure is on your shoulders. If you follow the blueprint, even if it's been total dog  " }, 

{ "sentence": " shit the last 10 times that you've tried it, but we followed the blueprint. You know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we did the thing that was the same before. Michael Malice, like personal, literal professional  " }, 

{ "sentence": " internet troll, told me when we, one of the first times that we met, I wouldn't be able to say  " }, 

{ "sentence": " one 10th of the shit that I can if I was taller than five foot seven. He's like a small guy,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but he can get away with being kind of like the Loki of politics on Twitter. Because if he's,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know, six foot five and built like Alan Richer, it's going to seem like he's bullying.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But there's something funny about him like, like, you know, dip, dip, dip in a way.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " There's also something like, until you win, effort always goes unnoticed.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I realized this with, and it made me like a little dispirited, how fallible  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people are around success. So do you remember Billy McFarland guy that did fire festival,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that festival at Pablo Escobar's Island, and then everyone got stranded and nearly died.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " If he'd been able to pull off an even remotely passable event,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people would have hailed him as a marketing genius.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Regardless of the fact that he was continually flying back to New York to raise money in an  " }, 

{ "sentence": " unethical way for a project that he didn't know if it was going to work and all the rest of this stuff.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So literally the line between  " }, 

{ "sentence": " charlatan grifter, who's out of his depth and visionary pioneer who makes things work when  " }, 

{ "sentence": " no one else believes that they can is just outcome.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Everyone thinks you're crazy until it works.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so, I mean, if, if you think of, of the outcome as the trump card, then all of the pain  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and suffering that you lead up to that point, if you're just, I'm trying to think of a,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " an appropriate saying, um, I was gonna say balls deep, certain, um, that no matter what you will  " }, 

{ "sentence": " die or you will get there, then the likelihood that all of the things that you've done up to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that point will then be justified in retrospect is super high. And I actually see that as super,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " compelling as a, as a thing to latch onto in harder times.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yes, but the ends justifying the means is a slippery slope.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm a Machiavellian guy, so.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Have you seen, speaking of that, and you mentioned Robert Greene earlier on,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " uh, you should buy the 25th anniversary edition of 48 Laws of Power, which just came out last year.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's leather bound, gold embossed.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I have.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Oh, you got it? And you've seen the thing on the edges?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " His face is very cool.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The best.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The, the.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Super Bowl printing.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Dude, so for the people that don't know, you remember you would get those things in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " packets of cereal when you were a kid and you could sort of move a, a little bit of plastic  " }, 

{ "sentence": " from left to right and it would look like a football player was running or something like that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's basically the same, but on the edge of a book. If it's flat, it's just gold foil.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " If you open it one way so that the pages splay out, it's Robert Greene's face.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And if you open it, so the pages splay out in the other way, it's Machiavelli's face.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The fucking.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Coolest book.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Just.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I've seen a lot of.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Influencer gifting of books is a big deal at the moment, you know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " send the book out and maybe they'll post about it and it'll help with sales or whatever.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And there's some very elaborate ways.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm sure that you've received some of these.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Um, cause I know that you're on the same mailing list.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " There's some of these that are super, super elaborate.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I remember being like, oh, that was like, I don't know, like cool or whatever.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But that Robert Greene book, as soon as I saw that it did that and I, I'm sending a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " fucking video of this to anyone that I can, like, this is like magic.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What is it?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You're doing sales because you sucked at marketing.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You're doing marketing because you sucked at product.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That's a great novelism.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's so funny.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Cause, um, like with the book launch, I, I, I didn't do any of that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I just always, I wanted people, I want people to read the book.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Cause like, if someone posts about the book before the book's out, then like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I wanted no one to have read the book until the day it was out, you know?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Um, but yeah, I'm, the, the longer I've been in at least the business game and we were  " }, 

{ "sentence": " talking about legendary foods.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Um, it's just product.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like I had a roommate way back in the day, who's now a really successful entrepreneur.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And we were both like early days, poor as shit.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Um, we happen to live together and he read this book.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " He just told me the title.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It just like stuck with me.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " He said, too good to fail.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I just love that as a frame.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, if I opened a sandwich shop, how can I make the sandwiches too good?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like just, if someone takes a bite, they're like, fuck, this is the best sandwich I've ever  " }, 

{ "sentence": " had.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, if you just get that, then the rest of it doesn't matter.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so when you're like, I mean, I think about this in business decisions, but probably  " }, 

{ "sentence": " also in life decisions is I think Tim Ferriss talks about this, the one big domino.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, what is the one thing that if I just get this one thing, right,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everything else shrinks into a relevance.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I think about that from like the hero story of what you said with Joe Rogan, which  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I love that frame.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, okay, boom.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Now you're present in your movie.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What would that guy do?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, well, what one big thing could that guy accomplish that would make all of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the mediocrity of your life up to this point irrelevant?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And why are you not putting every single ounce of your effort to prove that one point so that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you could then justify everything up to that point?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So it wouldn't have been mediocrity.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It would have been the path to get there.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Journey.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Exactly.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Thank you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It would have been the journey.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " People want to find their passion, but you don't find it, you create it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And you create it by getting good at something.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And to get good at stuff, you start by doing something you suck at.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Then you get good.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Then you like it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Then people ask how you found your passion.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Answer.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " By starting when you sucked and not giving up.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I hate the passion mantra.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I really do.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I mean, part of it was because, um, I'll even, I'll even play it out.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So I, I read all the same self-help books early on when I was, you know, in my entrepreneurial  " }, 

{ "sentence": " days and I was trying to find my passion and I was into fitness.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I was deciding between fitness test prep.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Cause I was good at test prep and a frozen yogurt.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Cause I like dessert.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Right.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So I've like, these are my three quote passions, which let's just translate that into things  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're interested in.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so as soon as I started the gym, my passion disappeared, it became work.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I had a different mentor later in my life who said, never create work around your passion,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because then it'll become work.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And he was a guy who was a very successful business guy.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I think about that actually more than I, than I share, because it's just complete and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " utter bullshit because it assumes that what you're going to be doing every day is the thing that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're currently really interested, which also doesn't make you money.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so your behavior has to change.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And whenever you're doing these new things, one, they'll be new, which means you will suck at them,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " which means you'll probably not like them, but it's also part of it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so like, I would prefer to take the extreme opposite position of everything will suck.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And eventually you will get good at the things that you suck at.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then you'll enjoy being competent at that thing, which will then probably give you status.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And you'll enjoy the fruits of status more than the pain of doing the thing.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And in so doing create a positive feedback loop that you'll actually keep sticking with it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I'd rather set the expectation that everything is terrible all the time forever.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Now, let's see if we can make our, now let's see if we can become the person who can still do it  " }, 

{ "sentence": " anyways and start that as the baseline rather than trying to assume that I need perfect conditions  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in order to start because I mean, starting is the perfect condition.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like whatever condition that you're in that you start was the perfect condition.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " There is such a thing as intrinsic motivation though, as well as extrinsic.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You can do something that there's a whole myriad of things that you could be potentially good at.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And many of them could give you renown and money and social clout and that feedback loop.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But there are some that you will enjoy doing for the sake of doing them more.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I don't disagree. I was, remember a note that I wrote to myself when I first started the podcast  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and I decided to turn pro with it, which is one way to turn something you love into a labor is to monetize it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Okay.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because as soon as you decide that you're going to really, really go for this,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you want to turn pro at something, I use this example in my live show of a pickleball player.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So this guy loves playing pickleball and he gets to turn up on a Saturday and play with his friends.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " If it's cold outside, he doesn't need to go and play.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And if he's tired, he doesn't need to go and play.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And if he's hungover, he doesn't need to go and play.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then he decides to turn pro.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And he thinks I'm turning pro at this thing that I love.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I can't wait to make what I love into my career.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But he doesn't realize that, hey, guess what?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " If you're hungover, you still need to go and train.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Well, actually, no, you don't get to be hungover anymore because the guy that isn't hungover is the guy  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's training better.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So you now need to stop going out with your friends and you need to train when it's cold.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And you need to work on game tape and mindset and hydration and nutrition.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You need to do S&C and you need to have a physio and you need to not see a family as much.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " All of these things came along for the ride as soon as you decided to turn pro.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Is that a price that you're prepared to pay?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And that's an interesting question to ask yourself.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Am I prepared to sacrifice my pure, unencumbered, unmolested love for this thing in order to try  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and become the best at this thing?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think it's really tough.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I'm going to shoot my own advice right now in the head, or at least my positioning right now,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " which is that it's very easy for someone in my position or in your position to say,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this is kind of what it takes and, or rather, this is like, you should find your passion.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because like, transparently, what I do now every day, I actually really do love.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I live more or less the same day, seven days a week.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And like, I'll tell you what it is just so we can have context.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But I wake up, and then I go to my office here, and I work for six hours writing my next book.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then I take two hours-ish of calls, typically.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then after that, I lift in the gym that I custom designed with all the pieces that I love.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then I go and eat with my wife.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then I go to my condo, and I sit in my recliner that overlooks the entire city.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I read.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then I go to bed.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I do that every day.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I love every aspect of the day, with the exception of maybe the two hours of calls that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I have to take.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But I see those as a necessary thing for everything else that I have there.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Now, could I stop doing that?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Maybe.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But for me to say that that's what your day needs to look like in order to get  " }, 

{ "sentence": " into the top floor with the view that looks over these things.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so that you can not make money for two years while you write a book  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that eventually makes money or whatever is not true.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so it's the difference between like, oh, I should fly private because that's what rich  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people do.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I should play basketball because I want to be tall.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And modeling the behavior at the top of the mountain rather than the climb.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so they're completely different.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so this whole idea, unfortunately, and I don't blame the people who do this, is they  " }, 

{ "sentence": " see their current life, like I would see mine, and say, well, what do I do now?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I do everything that I love.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Okay.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But I didn't get here doing everything that I love.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I did a fuckload of shit I hate.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I did it for a very long period of time.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I did not have anyone to root me on.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And in fact, I had many people who were actively trying to destroy my path and tell me why it was  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a terrible idea.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I had this idea about why you should stop taking advice from successful people,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because most of their advice is not about what they did when they were at your stage.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's about what they do now.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Right.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And it's the same thing around pushing work-life balance.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You know, what I found after 50 years at Disney is that really the most important thing is,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " well, all right, well, how did you get to this stage?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What did you do when you were two years in?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because that's where I am.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What did you do when you were broken living on the gym floor?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because that's where I am.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Don't tell me about the complicated routine or the balance or the flying private.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The bar stool is upside down and you're mixing up the ends for the means.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Everything on my write up.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So this is, I mean, I remember in a lot of excruciating detail what it took me to get here.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Um, but I will say that I had a ruthless focus on dollars per hour.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I'm just giving tactical advice right now, but everything that I could trade away for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " more time doing the thing that made me money was what I did.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I remember the first time I made a $500 sale and it took me 30 minutes.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I was like, every hour of every day, this is what I'm going to do.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And anything that is not talking to someone in exchange for them giving me a credit card  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so that I can charge it and make $500, anything that makes me less than $250 per hour or per,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " per 30 minutes I'm giving to somebody else.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so after that first sale, I was like, I'm never cooking again.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm never going grocery shopping again.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm not cleaning again.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Cause I knew that in one sale I could pay for that person for the month.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so like, like the ruthless focus on what can I do that creates an input to output being money  " }, 

{ "sentence": " equation and me, at least for me, it was pouring everything I possibly could into the input  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and eliminating everything else.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I made this video on Facebook before I was quote Alex Ramosi years ago, when I still had six gems  " }, 

{ "sentence": " before I even did the turnarounds.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I made this video almost as documentation, but I said, so I want to open up my seventh,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " eighth, ninth and 10th location.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I have the spots picked out and I'm already working all of the hours that I'm awake.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I've already given up Saturdays.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So the only thing that I have left is like Sundays and evenings.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I am no longer going to be watching any football and I'm no longer going to have Netflix  " }, 

{ "sentence": " at all.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And that is what I'm giving up for seven, eight, nine, and 10.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I remember just making this video of like, that's what I'm sacrificing.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I think a lot of people create these to-do lists when in my experience, it's been so much  " }, 

{ "sentence": " more useful to write down all the things that I'm willing to sacrifice because if you sacrifice  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everything, there's nothing left than to do the one thing that matters.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I think Jerry Seinfeld talks about this from a writing perspective.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " He says that every day, no matter what he sits down and he writes for two hours.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Now he doesn't have to write, but he's not allowed to do anything else.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so he can sit there, but there's nothing else to do except for write jokes.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I think a lot about that from the climb perspective, which is like most of everyone  " }, 

{ "sentence": " who's listening to this, who isn't achieving what they want is with their time.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " They think that they're spending all their time working, but your output, like you don't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " even know how to work.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm being really real with you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like you think you know how to work.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You don't know how to work.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like the amount of output, like, and I'll measure this by like, what is your output?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's probably not as high as you think.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so rather than trying to learn all these productivity hacks, the ultimate productivity hack  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is no, no, is you stop doing shit.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then when you create space, then you can fill it with the thing that matters.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But trying to add on more to your schedule of all the things that you're not willing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to sacrifice is the very reason that you're not doing what you need to do.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " A lot of people would look at that life of, I'm going to sacrifice evenings,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and I'm not going to watch football anymore and say, well, what's the point?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " If you make yourself miserable on route to achieving the goal, if most of your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " life is journey, not destination, and it makes you miserable on route to it, why do that?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So that was the thing I was mentioning earlier where it's like, let's take the absolute extreme  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of it's going to suck and it's going to last forever.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " How can I be okay in that circumstance?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I do have the fundamental belief that circumstance has nothing to do with how,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what your subjective well-being is.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so if monks can be super chill in wherever monks do monk things and have nothing and have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " higher subjective well-being ratings than anyone else here in the Western world, it clearly isn't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " external. And so then if I'm going to be just as miserable, being mediocre as I am doing this  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's going to amount to something, then I might as well do the that's going to amount to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " something and be miserable there and at least have something to show for it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " There's this story I learned about Victor Hugo, famous writer from history.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Do you know this about what he did with his servant?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So Victor Hugo needed to make himself right. So he paid his servant each night during the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " middle of the night to come into his bedroom and remove the bedclothes from him, turn the heating  " }, 

{ "sentence": " off and then lock his bedroom door from the outside. And he wasn't allowed to leave until Victor slid  " }, 

{ "sentence": " six pages of handwritten work underneath. So, you know, you look at Opal, which is this app for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " iPhone, which stops you from using apps or frozen turkey, cold turkey, which is the same thing for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " desktop. And that's just the digital equivalent of Victor Hugo being locked in his bedroom with no  " }, 

{ "sentence": " bedding and just a quill and a few pieces of paper and then having to slide it underneath the door.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I want to push back on something that you said right before Victor Hugo,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " which is, you know, somebody might ask like, why would you do all this stuff if you're not happy?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That assumes that my goal in life is to be happy.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What is your goal in life?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " To do epic shit.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Genuinely. To be useful. And so...  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Why place do epic shit over be happy?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because when I look back on my life in retrospect, the things that bring me the most joy in the moment  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are the things that I was willing to sacrifice for, for an extended period of time.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And those pay memory dividends far greater than the momentary cost that I had at the moment.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I think it's a long-term short-term thing, but a frame that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " continued to paralyze me for a long period of time was an obsession with happiness.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like it was truly an obsession. It was an obsession of mine in college. I almost,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I almost got into positive psychology because I thought that was really interesting. And that's what I,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's what I, my passion, right? I consumed all that stuff and I drove myself mad with it. And I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " actually was more sad and depressed than anything, which is probably why I was trying to find all this  " }, 

{ "sentence": " positive hippy dippy stuff. And I just cracked one day and I was like, fuck happiness.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because it felt so out of reach that I was like, just fuck it. I'm just not, I'm not even,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm not even going to shoot for it. I'm just going to do stuff. And that's all I'm going to do. I'm  " }, 

{ "sentence": " just going to do stuff. And what happened was like a few years later, dot, dot, dot, a few days later,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I looked up and I was like, huh, I'm not miserable. And so I actually identified for a very long period  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of time as I'm not a happy person, comma, and that's okay. I'm fine with that. I accept that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And there was this huge conflict for such a long period of time where I was like, you're supposed  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to be happy. Why aren't you happier? Like there's something wrong. There's something wrong with you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Something needs to change. Rather than saying like, maybe the level of happy that you are is fine.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Who am I like? What happy am I comparing myself to? And also, if whatever your current state is,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you just say like, happier, which is really when people are like, I want to be happy. They're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " just saying, I want to be happier than I am, which means that you create this distance between where  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you are and where you want to be, which is the recipe for being unhappy is saying that I want to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " be happier. So it doesn't matter how happy you are. You want to be happier. And so by relinquishing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the desire to be happy, I ended up enjoying a lot more of the stuff that I was doing because I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " didn't make it a requisite for, for my activities. So then it became a pleasant surprise. I was like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " oh, this doesn't suck. Huh? How nice. Two famous psychologists, Daniel Gilbert and Daniel Kahneman  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have quite divergent views on happiness. It's quite interesting. So Daniel Gilbert talks about how  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you spent every minute of the rest of your life on a floaty lilo in a pool drinking cocktails,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in retrospect, you might not have found much meaning, but each individual moment of experience  " }, 

{ "sentence": " would have been enjoyable. And he believes that that constitutes to him a life that is well-lived.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I disagree with this guy entirely. Daniel Kahneman, and this is my position too, which is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a well-lived life is one which in retrospect, you are glad that you lived, right? So one is leaning  " }, 

{ "sentence": " toward hedonic pleasure and the other is leaning toward meaning. So one you could say is happiness  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and the other is meaning. It's my belief that your disposition largely influences where on that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " spectrum from lilo to do hard things, you need to sit and you will have friends. And I did for a very  " }, 

{ "sentence": " long time in the nightlife industry, have friends that just seem to be so fucking happy not doing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " stuff. Like just, they would float through life and they wouldn't ask themselves, am I actualizing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " my fucking virtue? Is this the highest integrity that I can do with these things and all the rest  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of it? And I was envious of those people. Have you ever seen a dog? You see a dog on the floor and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's just lying there and you think, oh my God, if only I could be that dog. Like it just wants to go for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a walk and have food and like go pee pee. That's it. That's all it wants to do. And you think,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " fuck, it would be great to be that dog. But like, guess what? If your constitution doesn't allow you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to be that dog, the only way out is through. And this was something, the first time that I went to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " go and see Peterson, someone asked him a question and they said, the depth of my consciousness causes  " }, 

{ "sentence": " me to suffer. Is it a blessing or a curse to feel everything so deeply? And he thought for a little  " }, 

{ "sentence": " bit and he said, take more of the thing that poisons you until you turn it into a tonic that girdles  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the world around you. The only way out is through. And it's kind of like, as soon as you realize  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that there are things that you do that give you satisfaction and there are things that other people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " do that give them happiness and you've tried that route, the only way is to continue doing the thing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that you know that works. And I think that you are an example of someone who is optimizing heavily  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for meaning rather than for hedonism. And that's not to say that there are people, and this is,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I said this on the last episode, the fundamental thing that people don't understand as far as I can  " }, 

{ "sentence": " tell about your worldview is that the thing that you do for work and the thing that you do for fun are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the same thing. They can't imagine that because that's not the way that it is for them. And it's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " not maybe the way it is for most people. But if you are the sort of person that finds meaning more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " enjoyable than happiness, you need to optimize for the thing that you enjoy the most.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I'll toss in. And meaning lasts longer. And so I'll be super upfront. If that, those friends  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of yours in the nightlife, there's nothing wrong with that in my way, like as I see the world. Like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if that's you and you're like, I fucking love everything I do, then like you won. Like just keep  " }, 

{ "sentence": " doing that. You know what I mean? But I think a lot of the message that Chris and I are saying here  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is if you've tried that path and it hasn't worked for you, then you have this dark door that's in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the corner that you've been trying all the other ones that have nice gold edges and really shiny  " }, 

{ "sentence": " things. But there's that door that you keep looking at. And it's the other side of you that's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " clearing his throat in the other room. And it's like, you just have to bust through the door.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I think that the, like giving yourself permission to be unhappy, or at least for me,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " giving myself permission to be unhappy for an extended period of time in order to get what I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " wanted gave me so much relief from, honestly, I don't like using the word nowadays because it has  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so many associations, but just from like the depression or the funk that I was in for a few  " }, 

{ "sentence": " years. Yeah. I just, I just didn't like my life and I'd achieved by most measure,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because I, I did, I don't have the, um, I, you know, school failed me. I was a, whatever.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like I wasn't that I finished in three years and I did really well in school and I had a really good  " }, 

{ "sentence": " job. Um, but it was empty for me. And so my, like my goal is things we talked about earlier,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but my, my personal goal is to squeeze every ounce of potential out of whatever I have.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I think that if you feel like you have potential left over, then it will eat you alive  " }, 

{ "sentence": " until you do something about it. Not to piss off the positive pollies in the room,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but if you haven't gotten what you want, then you're not worthy of it, period. And that's okay.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Now you can admit that you suck and improve better to know you're bad for a season than pretend you're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " good for a lifetime. You're not making as much money as you want because you're not as good as  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you think you are. You're not struggling from imposter syndrome. You're a student and pretending  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to be a teacher. No students say they feel like frauds for trying to learn. You're a fraud when you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " get up to teach the class and you've never done it. Deep.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think it's just giving yourself permission to suck. It's giving yourself permission to be unhappy.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's giving yourself permission to not achieve while you do for a long period of time. It's giving  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yourself permission to lose friends. It's giving yourself permission to do things that's different  " }, 

{ "sentence": " than people in your social circle or your age group are doing. It's giving you permission,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " giving yourself permission to be an exception so that you can become exceptional. And a lot of that,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the whole positive poly mantra of like the, I saw that, I saw a post a girl made and she was like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you are worthy. And that's what made that tweet. All my tweets are just responses to shit I see.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so this girl was like, you're like, I say this to myself in the morning, like you are worthy.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You are amazing. You are a goddess. And I was like, you're not a goddess because you don't control me.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Um, and you don't have the things that you want. You keep thinking that you saying that you're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " worthy is going to somehow make it true. But like the way that you know, you're worthy is that you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have it. That's it. Like that is the litmus test. Are you worthy of a billion dollars? Well,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are you a billionaire? No, then you're not worthy. And so just like, I think we have these things.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's just like, uh, you're unbalanced. It's like, you're not worthy. There's these things that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " were programmed to say, Oh, that's bad. You have to tell everyone they're worthy. You're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everyone's beautiful. No, if everyone are beautiful, then no one's beautiful. And yet again, we're back  " }, 

{ "sentence": " at square one. And so it's, it's, I guess, drinking the tonic. It's, it's going through the shit,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " which is honestly the boring stuff that no one wants to do for an extended period of time.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And, uh, accepting that you suck and that it is okay because the first step is accepting that you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " stuck, you suck so that you can do the second step, which is doing something about it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What about you're not making as much money as you want because you're not as good as you think you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are? That's, I mean, I'm obviously in the business space and that follows up with the other  " }, 

{ "sentence": " one with the imposter syndrome. People are like, man, um, how do you not suffer from imposter  " }, 

{ "sentence": " syndrome? I was like, because I've done what I said I've done. And the people who get up on stage  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and try and teach a class on shit they haven't done. It's like that, like you feel like an imposter  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when you're an imposter, like don't try and kill that voice, listen to that voice and get the evidence  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to make that voice shut the fuck up. Like if, like, if I get on stage and I say, I can bench 315,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is there like, do I feel like an imposter when I say that? No, I stay fact.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Presumably if you're, if you're pioneering and breaking new ground, you know, you're, you just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " put the biggest investments that you ever did into this new thing. That is a new level that you get  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to. And that's one that's to do with finance, but there could be another one that's to do with  " }, 

{ "sentence": " capacity or competence. You could be sitting down in a room doing a deal, which is time bound in a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " way that it's never been before, or is in an industry only tangential to one that you've been  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in before. Each time that you do something new, by definition, you're an imposter because you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " haven't done it before. Now, if you're teaching, that's different. But if you're entering, if you're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " growing sufficiently quickly, most of the time it's fresh snow.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So I like, this is a fat, a topic I love, but I think the difference between doing something new  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and being an imposter is one is pretending to be something that they're not. So like I made the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " biggest investment school. I'm making a bet that I think communities are going to be huge. And I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " think that there's a ton of people who want to learn, you know, teach skills they have in communities,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " etc. And school.com can help. But like, it would only be an imposter if I said, this is like, I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " guarantee it no matter what, this is going to be the biggest thing ever. And one of the big things that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I repeat, and from the marketing front, I say it all the time, I say, state the facts and tell the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " truth. Like the best marketing in the entire world is truth. Now, if the truth isn't compelling,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it doesn't mean you lie. It means you change the world to make the facts compelling. As in,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if I say, man, I want to be like, I, you see this one all the time. 18 year olds are like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I want to be a motivational speaker, right? You say, okay, well, what are your facts? You've done  " }, 

{ "sentence": " nothing. Great. So they then lie so that they can try and claim success that they don't deserve. So  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they can get authority that they can't back up and eventually are called out and are flattened. To be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " fair, they only impress people who don't know anything anyways. So if they're honest about it,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they look at their fact sheet and say, what would, what would a motivational speaker have to have in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " order for them to have authority. And then that becomes your action list of what you need to do.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then once those facts are the truth, then you can state the facts and tell the truth. And then  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people will be like, wow, that's so motivational. But all you did was tell the truth. And so like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that is why I so wholeheartedly rejected one, like you are worthy. You're not worthy. If you had it,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " then you wouldn't even need to say you were worthy because you'd already fucking have it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And if you were in, like, I struggle with imposter syndrome. Why? You only struggle with imposter  " }, 

{ "sentence": " syndrome because you're fucking lying. Like, that's why you feel like an imposter. And now  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they're like, why didn't, the thing is, is you can fudge the truth. Like you can, you can not lie  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is very different than telling the truth. Like I can make something seem a certain way without  " }, 

{ "sentence": " deliberately breaking the law, but I'll know. And that's why you feel like an imposter because you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " fucking know. And there's the guy in the other room is clearing his throat and be like, that's not  " }, 

{ "sentence": " fucking true. And then that discord. But if you just say what you have done, or you say what you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are doing, I'm making this big investment. It's a big bet for me. The reason I'm making this bet is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because I see this trend and I think it's a good idea. I could be fucking wrong, but I'm not going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to feel like an imposter because of it, because that's the truth. Thinking about the community thing,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I had a conversation a little while ago. I don't, I don't think that you're, that you're far off wrong,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " especially in an age of automation. This guy made a really great point, which you probably  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is one of the very few things that you can't automate is community.  " }, 
{ "sentence": " we're dumping on shit this episode period  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and of course like every other episode you got that exclusive way to man before the drop  " },

{ "sentence": " the era we're in now is being women and how men operate so like i want to get more into that so go  " }, 

{ "sentence": " ahead lead us get us all back girl so do y'all feel like men are functioning like lower at an all-time  " }, 

{ "sentence": " low nowadays oh that's a good question you know what i think it's kind of like um it's like a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " circle of men and women doing it because they're only doing what we're allowing okay accountability  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know what i'm saying so i feel like i try not to get into the whole like gender war thing a lot  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because we used to do that a lot but i feel like we are in a day and age where men feel like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they are the prize just because they have money yeah and that they are the cream of the crop just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because they have money you are uh so and i'm not talking about anybody particular i'm not saying count  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but i'm just saying a man can be a bad father he can be a bad lover a bad partner a horrible son a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " horrible friend but he feels like i'm that because i have money and you should be honored to be here  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so i think and in turn women are making them feel that way just because they have money they can buy  " }, 

{ "sentence": " them a chanel bag so i think everybody is kind of functioning in love oh that's a great  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i mean it's the truth it is very much the truth i think and i always say this because even when  " }, 

{ "sentence": " poor mine started we had a whole thing where we would call them bdbs and we'd be like girl if you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " don't have you a bdb you need to send him to the curb what's a bdb a big dick baller so that's what we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but that's i mean but we started the show when i was what 27 you were yeah so your mindset changes  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the mindset changes and it's like now that you know we're like making our own money and like we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have just our mind has elevated and i realized like i was functioning low with my thought process  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so i think a lot of it is just like everybody is kind of like grasping at straws and trying to figure  " }, 

{ "sentence": " out why it's everybody else and it's like y'all need to look within yeah because that's what i did  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because when i tell you when i upgraded my mentality i started attracting better men in my dating life  " }, 

{ "sentence": " even if i was dating somebody and it didn't work out it was a good experience yeah we could go  " }, 

{ "sentence": " separate ways and i was like you know what this didn't work out but it was a good time like thank  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you you know what i'm saying so yeah i think it's definitely both ways you're doing more reflecting  " }, 

{ "sentence": " than projecting yes i like that i love a word like most of the emphasis like the number one emphasis  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is money so that's like allowing these to not have to really do the work yeah you know like they  " }, 

{ "sentence": " don't really need to do the self-work they don't need to really make sure they're an upstanding guy  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as long as you got money that's all that matters right right like can you even help me change my  " }, 

{ "sentence": " tire do you pray do you have a good relationship with your mama literally these don't even take the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " trash out no right you know how to do yeah so that makes a lot of sense i feel like money is like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like the main characteristic we go after nowadays well especially being young that's the only thing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you think to go after for sure especially in this industry everything is like we moving fast everybody  " }, 

{ "sentence": " see girls getting cars girls getting this girls getting that so it's like that's what we want  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but it's like is this person really a good person or is he just a with some money right focused on  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like looking for a way out the exterior yeah yeah looking for a way out instead of like you said just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " doing the work on yourself like become your own boss so you can attract somebody that's meeting you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " where you at yeah i agree because i always feel like i mean of course everybody wants a man who's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " ambitious successful you know what i'm saying but that it that just can't be it yeah you know what i'm  " }, 

{ "sentence": " saying so we trying to steer the girls into the light and i just feel like unfortunately i think i've  " }, 

{ "sentence": " said this before on our podcast too the the niggas is just not doing it no more like they're not  " }, 

{ "sentence": " really falling for that no more yeah they've been wanting to find the girls who really got something  " }, 

{ "sentence": " going on yeah i always tell everybody around me that like it's so much more than just being cute  " }, 

{ "sentence": " mm-hmm because being cute gonna get you through the door but like who you are and what you have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and what you have to bring to the table is what's gonna keep you in that door i agree so it's like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and also i do feel like men can smell like when you just hungry or looking for a come up like they  " }, 

{ "sentence": " gonna treat you like that they treating you like damn this really trying to work her move on me  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so now i'm really about to play you they play a part too because they always advocating like they  " }, 

{ "sentence": " don't want a girl to do nothing like oh yeah just chill or if you too busy it's like they  " }, 

{ "sentence": " don't like that but that's a manipulation that you really start sitting on your ass that's that's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when they go outside that's manipulation and then they don't want you nowhere now they gonna go find  " }, 

{ "sentence": " somebody who who got emotion who getting their own money after they then stopped you from getting your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " own money so it's like and that's what i always tell the girls too don't be afraid of starting over  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like i found myself in a situation with a guy who was like on and off for seven years and i was just like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i have to make this work because i put all this time in and this and that right and it was just like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for what like you cannot be afraid of starting over and betting on yourself right at the end of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the day it's like a billion people in the world you know so it's like if a situation is not working  " }, 

{ "sentence": " out nothing should feel forced you know what i mean no right no not yet y'all want kids i do i want  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to have like two yeah yeah kids are fun but take your time for sure like it's not a rush people always  " }, 

{ "sentence": " say it's not a rush oh i'm gonna take my time but like you i bring that up because you're like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's okay to start over but when you have a kid it's harder it's not that easy to say that and i  " }, 

{ "sentence": " always be trying to tell people this like it's so easy to be like that when you don't have a kid  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because that's why i be telling my friends like yeah your heart might be broke but you ain't got no  " }, 

{ "sentence": " baby yeah you could get the on so that's the difference when it's like you got a child and you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are trying to build something for your child it's like dang i mean is it really that easy  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is it really that easy right so what is like the criteria like if you're dating  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like when do you feel like you would introduce your son to somebody  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's that's tricky oh you're so messy  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i don't know honestly  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i don't know how i feel about that oh yeah i don't know about that we're gonna have a lot  " }, 

{ "sentence": " honestly i haven't got there yet yeah like to really like i'm surrendering to a man and i'm like okay now  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's time for you to meet my son yeah yeah it's not there you don't need to know my personal business  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yeah because he is very messy but that's smart though i feel like that's better than like just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " introducing him to anybody yeah yeah i don't play that and you know what's crazy because one thing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i say about men they will introduce anybody to their kids they will yeah and that's gonna be girls that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " be like girl i met his daughter girl we all did right but no value we all know nothing we all know  " }, 

{ "sentence": " absolutely yeah and i'd be having everybody around we put more value in that we'd be like yeah  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yeah the mama i have to really really be serious about you right to meet my child me and they just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " be like oh yeah this is my fucking weed right now yeah okay well the reason dr grant called him low  " }, 

{ "sentence": " functioning is because he has eight kids and she feels like he has a lot of broken homes so um do  " }, 

{ "sentence": " y'all feel like marriage is bigger than having a baby with somebody a bigger commitment because he  " }, 

{ "sentence": " basically was saying that he's scared of marriage and i don't want to make this about him but the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " episode was so viral that i feel like everyone yeah it was very i was like taking notes while i  " }, 

{ "sentence": " was watching it because it was like it was very like yeah it was i mean i think that's crazy when  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people say that i think that's absolutely insane i think children are a way bigger commitment than  " }, 

{ "sentence": " marriage because children are forever people always love to say that 18 year thing but it's like okay  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yeah y'all have to communicate more during that 18 years but like this person is in your life forever  " }, 

{ "sentence": " y'all don't have the same grandchildren this is always going to be your child so all of these  " }, 

{ "sentence": " milestones that they meet even in adulthood y'all are going to have to still see each other and be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " around each other so i think it's way more of a commitment once a marriage is dissolved especially  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if there's no children involved you don't have to deal with that person you don't have to talk  " }, 

{ "sentence": " y'all really can go y'all separate ways yeah damn that's crazy i didn't think about it that way the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " grandkids you gotta see that girl forever forever literally and i think so deep as far as like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " funerals and stuff like yes this is a lifelong thing and to me marriage is lifelong as well because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i don't believe in divorce forever i feel like once you marry to a person you marry to them forever  " }, 

{ "sentence": " biblically that's how it works but it is i just i feel like they both are huge commitments and i feel like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " men nowadays are just doing it like it's nothing like that's my baby mama oh we don't talk no more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like yeah it's so crazy yeah like and i remember i watched an interview with um michelle obama and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " she said like during her marriage with brock they had like um it was like a six or seven years where  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they just were not seeing eye to eye for six or seven years i've seen that and it's like the level of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know commitment you know what i'm saying so i feel like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like i do think that kids are a bigger commitment than marriage but honestly i feel like if you do  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it right they both kind of go hand in hand yeah you commit your you have to you know focus on a child  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but you also have to focus on your marriage as well so i don't know i just feel like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i could not see myself just like having a baby with anybody yeah and just being like oh you know  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i'm gonna make a little check real quick he got money yeah or i'm trying to trap this girl so she  " }, 

{ "sentence": " don't leave me alone it's just it's crazy to me to bring a human being in this world who is innocent  " }, 

{ "sentence": " now they got to deal with y'all's back and forth you know just for weird reasons why you decided to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " bring them here that's why you have to be so intentional and i feel like that is a reason  " }, 

{ "sentence": " why i only have one yeah because i see the impact that it has on my child of me and the father not  " }, 

{ "sentence": " always seeing eye to eye so it's like i can't do that again i want to at least do it when i'm married  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if i'm married you know like i don't want to just play like that no more and that is when i did have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a different mindset because if i had the mindset i had now i would have waited to have a child but  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everything happened i had to go through that in order to get to this point like oh i ain't playing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like that no more because they should have serious but i do say your situation was different because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you were with this person you were in love i'm pretty sure at the time you thought y'all were going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to be together forever right so it was it was a definitely like your child was made out of love yeah  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but just because you with a person that don't mean it's time for y'all to have a baby right  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because everything that's why i advocate wait because a lot of things change after a baby is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " involved it's like the respect that a man had for you before you have his child it's like they know  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're gonna be here forever so it's just like and i don't know i feel like that people just give up  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a little too easy like even with like marriage like what y'all just getting a divorce huh what happened to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " six years of sticking it out like we ain't gonna see eye to eye every day like people just think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everybody's super accessible and yeah it's it's like what's like oh i'm sorry oh i'm just gonna  " }, 

{ "sentence": " say to um add on to that uh me and my boyfriend we always say like we not gonna like each other  " }, 

{ "sentence": " every day but i love you every day i love that you know what i'm saying like i i i'm choosing to love  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you today i don't like you today and we get into it sometimes like we always kind of lighten up the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " boo he'd be like i don't like you right now like okay let me go my right right i'll be back  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right you know what i'm saying so i think it's just like the effort that you have to make and to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " realize like what's happening in this moment hey we're not seeing eye to eye that's okay i'm gonna  " }, 

{ "sentence": " come back tomorrow i'm gonna be back tomorrow yeah right i was gonna say like what's an example of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " something where you feel like people are giving up too early like what would be a deal breaker for you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " where you like okay i have to divorce you now that's crazy because that's literally our next question  " }, 

{ "sentence": " really it's a non-negotiable like what's your non-negotiable y'all are so good at i'm getting  " }, 

{ "sentence": " here i'm getting right i love it because i hope it just flow organic period i think a non-negotiable  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for me would be like cheating like stepping out like i can do your attitudes i can do us like you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " know we're not seeing eye to eye like okay you need your space but when you go to step out that's like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i mean that's a good one yeah i i think i'm the same i used to be that girl that was like um  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i thought it wasn't a deal breaker until i got cheated on yeah you can't see past it it broke me  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yeah so bad and it was to the point to where like i was questioning myself as a woman and then i had  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to realize girl you're amazing right you're beautiful you funny you got so much going on for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yourself just because he fucked up and he can't get his stuff together right that has nothing to do  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with you only to find out because y'all know i'm missing i'm nosy so i'll be getting all his tea still  " }, 

{ "sentence": " only to find out he's he doing the same thing to the next girl it was never you it was never  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and it's rarely ever the woman it's everything to do with him and nothing to do with you i literally  " }, 

{ "sentence": " had a moment like a few months ago where i really got on my knees and i thanked god for getting me  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because it was at one point i just didn't i was like how am i going to leave this man  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and i just never thought i was going to get out of it and when i got out of it and i'm like i'm on  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the other side i'm healthy i'm in a healthy relationship i'm happy and i was just like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it was never it was never me right you know what i'm saying so i think i realized like some women  " }, 

{ "sentence": " can deal with cheating you know like some people it's not a deal breaker for them they're understanding  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and it's no shade to them but i know what cheating does for me right because it's more than  " }, 

{ "sentence": " just the physical thing it's about that trust that you broke you know what i mean and you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's so hard to come back you start questioning yourself like now you're looking at yourself  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that does something to you mentally oh yeah for sure you know like you can't keep putting yourself  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we got to be very intentional with the situations we put ourselves in because we can it can change  " }, 

{ "sentence": " us completely like literally two years from now we're not even the same person like i don't even glow  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like i used to yes because i let you suffering everything because you can be whole and then you  " },

{ "sentence": " with each other like yeah like we definitely have been through our share of trials and tribulations  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in our friendship since we've started this podcast but i think now because we still have you know you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " still gonna have little issues with your friends every here every now and then but i just think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " now people can't tell yeah because when there was one was that last year it was last beginning of  " },

{ "sentence": " in the past y'all you could tell like we didn't even care we used to be we used to argue on camera  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like you but y'all gave it to the people raw like yeah just to see the growth yeah you know that's why  " },

{ "sentence": " ain't filming yeah like i don't give a damn you know yeah i'll be like did you get the wine i'm on  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the way but i do feel like having a platform with a with your person because i feel like friends are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like your person oh yeah it's way deeper than just that's my home girl yeah um it do put pressure  " },

{ "sentence": " y'all's chemistry and it it is weird because it's like you kind of put in your just like a having a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " boyfriend putting them on social media it's like you put in your relationship on the forefront for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people to judge so it is hard pick y'all apart that's yeah that's literally what they do to me  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and dance and it's so annoying because it's like like y'all not about to come in and try to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " up some we built for a year we look at that and laugh yeah we literally laugh like that yeah we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are ever since we was like kids our parents always said like they really instilled in us like i don't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " care what y'all do y'all don't let nobody come in between between y'all yeah like y'all can have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " other friends but don't let nobody ever come in between y'all yeah and i think that kind of just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " stuck with it it did stick with us because we get into it too yeah oh we get into it we don't get  " },

{ "sentence": " my ego to the side to say like i value your feelings like i value everything you feeling everything  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you telling me but we just gonna agree to disagree and that takes a lot of growth to get to that  " },

{ "sentence": " the uber to your house she said why wouldn't i oh jada real bad i said i would please i said  " },

{ "sentence": " i've been living in my building for two years she just moved to the building next to me like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " three months ago four months ago so it really was like a no-brainer type of thing i didn't mean it was  " }, 

{ "sentence": " an accident but you know when you drink this response like because why wouldn't i yeah we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " were drinking like no you did too don't drink it yeah but then the next morning she called me she's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like girl what time we getting ready i said girl i don't even know because we be knowing like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " over something yeah we get over so fast now because i think we honestly know like we was obviously  " }, 

{ "sentence": " drinking and you know how it is when the liquor be flowing and stuff so we can definitely tell the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " difference between like something that we definitely for real need to talk about when it's a real  " }, 

{ "sentence": " issue or us just being drunk and being sick exactly yeah i'll be seeing a lot of tick tocks y'all seen  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this tick tock y'all be on tick tock yeah i'm a tick tocker now auntie know what to do yeah wait i seen  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this tick tock it was like uh twirl your hips or date your best friend tight and a girl was like twirling  " }, 

{ "sentence": " her hips so hard do y'all feel like y'all make good choices and men like speaking on each other like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " do you feel like let's make good choices fuck no no hell no in what ways like i like her now like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the one she's talking about that she been talking about on this episode i like him but this is the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " first ever ever that anybody has liked i've never liked none of her niggas no nobody my sister my  " }, 

{ "sentence": " other best friend nobody so i'll give you that she just a lover like lex is a lover so i feel like in the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " past she would just fall for like the wrong niggas but because she's such a good person and she have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " such a giving heart she would give him so many chances and then be like snap out of it yeah  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so yeah that's the reason why i never liked the niggas because i just felt like she was too good for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " them yeah yeah i love that okay how do you feel about her choices and me or are you going to twirl your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " head baby i'm twirling the up baby boy you stay home my mind but the reason is being because like i  " }, 

{ "sentence": " said with her dating she got some thick skin because them be like i don't know i couldn't do it you can  " }, 

{ "sentence": " say what do you want to say you can say what you want to say okay it's just be like it'd be like the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " men that'd be like you know they'd be having money and you know they'd be taking care of her but they'd be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " having a lot of women it'd be a lot of things they're not going on i'll be like girl your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in the blogs again did you see but that was when i was young at all  " }, 

{ "sentence": " oh we i'm like did y'all see what y'all did she be like i don't care i don't care you know  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i'll be like oh my god so we're just totally different when it comes to our types like we're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " completely i think now like i like the guy that you know that she's been dealing with now like even  " }, 

{ "sentence": " though they have like you know their disagreements i still think like he respects her right he doesn't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " put her to where like she's not eating and going through you know stuff like that so i feel like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i always say this i don't judge the men that my friends date i always say as long as he's not beating  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you making you feel less than being emotionally abusive like we can deal with it we can deal with we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " can make it work so but i think now it's like she's in a healthy relationship and she has a lot  " }, 

{ "sentence": " more understanding so like you know if it was the guy that she's dating now i'm not gonna rock my hips  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i might shake it a little bit i'm gonna shake you sometimes he get on my nerves sometimes i ain't gonna  " }, 

{ "sentence": " twirl it i'm like good yeah he get a little yeah he get a little i ain't mad at that so how do y'all  " }, 

{ "sentence": " feel about venting about your relationship to your friends where's the line between oversharing and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " then like just wanting advice or asking for details unless you finna leave you're all you're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " finna do is make all your family and your friends hate him and make it even worse for when he comes  " }, 

{ "sentence": " around yeah so i think that if i can handle it in-house i'm gonna do that i've learned to like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like i'll tell her stuff about my relationship i'll be like girl let me tell you what happened  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but it's nothing like detrimental where it will change her opinion about him but if it's something  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like serious that's going on yeah i'll tell her but i just feel like little arguments and stuff like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that like you don't have to tell your friends everything we need to grow up for you because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we overshare yeah it's no boundaries bad at oversharing i used to overshare a lot with all  " }, 

{ "sentence": " my friends but then i feel like when you do that when it comes to your relationship it makes it hard to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " make decisions yeah because you have so many opinions from everybody um i think it's okay to vent to your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " friends and talk to them a little bit but like you don't want to overshare and tell them too much  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because like licks just said like they'll internalize the feelings and then you want to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " stay with them i do that real bad and now they hate his ass yeah because she used to hate my ex  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because i used to overshare yeah everything about our relationship but you needed to overshare because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you needed to hear what i had to say that's true i look at it like that too but then i started  " }, 

{ "sentence": " making then i started feeling like i was solely making decisions with him based off of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what she was yeah yeah and that's not good what you was really ready for because you know your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " tolerance yeah like you know when you're gonna be ready to be done with the situation and i used  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to feel like i wasn't necessarily done but i used to be feeling like oh she don't think i'm stupid  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yeah yeah oh i don't give a fuck we don't care about none of that call me the dumb  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right now yeah but because i'm going friend yeah that's just how it goes but it do becomes one of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " those things where it's like we'll tell each other exactly how we feel but it's like do what you feel  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like i'm gonna tell you i'm gonna tell you yeah but the choice is on you yeah make that decision  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for yourself but we share every detail well i think for us too like now we're to the point to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " where like we'll vent to each other and if i say dray what you think then she'll give me my opinion  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but if i'm just venting she just won't say nothing she won't say nothing and vice versa  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so we've created boundaries i was about to say that's a great boundary yes we don't have to create  " }, 

{ "sentence": " boundaries because sometimes i just want to vent i'm calling him a ass but you don't need to chime  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in and say he a ass yeah right you know what i'm saying so it's like it's it's definitely like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " boundaries that we know that we create because sometimes people just want to vent they don't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " need to hear well girl leave him yeah he tries like i just need to get this off my chest we we do  " }, 

{ "sentence": " understand that because a lot of things get lost in translation like you can't just be like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " telling somebody to do something now she's totally like missing the whole advice point you're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " trying to make yeah you gotta like know how to talk to your friends that's about understanding  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your friends you know how to like it's so hard to not tell your opinion on a situation when i feel  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like your feelings are yeah yeah yeah but especially when i feel like my friend's sad or her feelings  " }, 

{ "sentence": " hurt it's like okay so what's next what we doing yeah you know like how do we go about this how are we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " going to get to the bottom of this because this is not something that's new it has happened before  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right right so that that that be when it becomes hard so yeah yeah it's like seeing your friend go  " }, 

{ "sentence": " through the same thing yeah all right you want to chime in yeah i'm going to chime in i have to work  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on that though yeah i think we're getting better with that yeah if you feel like if you feel like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i'm getting better thank you i think so i feel like it's gonna come as y'all get older yeah because when  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we was y'all age we definitely yeah it takes time but like i said the respect and the love i have for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " her we had to learn our boundaries with each other i know what triggers her i know what makes her mad  " }, 

{ "sentence": " oh me i'll be like this been a piss drae off so let me do it and she used to do it all yeah that's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " me you know what i'm saying i'm gonna try to run and i used to fall in the trap every time  " }, 

{ "sentence": " still got it so but yeah i feel like i've grown a lot too though because we met when i was 23 and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " now i'm 33 and like it's just been a lot of growth in our friendship for sure individually over the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " past things always work when both people are trying to heal and be better than they were like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you always gonna have a good dynamic when everyone is pouring into themselves to help whatever y'all  " }, 

{ "sentence": " got yeah so y'all only gonna get better you know unless it just comes to a stage where it's like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " okay we're gonna go our separate race which is also fine but it's always gonna be healthy yeah you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " know because y'all have got to this point i feel like that is so important in relationships if  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everybody's putting in the work to being better yeah learning what triggers days like she learning  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what triggers me learning patterns with each other okay yes i'm gonna stay away because she  " }, 

{ "sentence": " got one of them little moves like all of that is important without like withholding a friendship or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " any type of relationship and to go into what like dad said earlier like you like you said like they  " }, 

{ "sentence": " always told y'all when y'all were little like don't let nobody come between y'all because navigating  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this space navigating just life in general is hard so the fact that y'all have that bond and y'all have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " each other is so important especially in this space because going into business with your friend  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's a different beast right i've seen so many podcasts start and fall apart and we have weathered  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the storm somehow and i just feel like it's important because i know at the end of the day  " }, 

{ "sentence": " nobody has my back like she does you know what i'm saying so it's like it's important to recognize that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and move accordingly with that you know what i'm saying and like doing whatever you got to do to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " keep it healthy yeah man like i'm not arguing with her about no money i'm not arguing with her about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " anything that has to do with like it i don't have an ego when it comes to her i always say it yeah  " },

{ "sentence": " advice you want to give like xyz but there's no blueprint to any kind of being an influencer a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " content creator there's no blueprint so it's like for me it was like the hardest thing was staying  " },

{ "sentence": " yeah to be honest because we have been doing it for so long and i'm not gonna lie like i'm kind of like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " an instant gratification type of person so for two years we weren't making any money so i completely  " }, 

{ "sentence": " understood why she wanted to do it but it did make me sad a little bit for sure yeah because like don't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " give up on the bigger picture yeah it's like if we keep going we really can make this something big  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but then i understood at the end of the day like that you got bills yeah yeah staying down is the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " hard part yeah yes because you're not always gonna see that that the glory or the the good side or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right at the end of the tunnel super quick like that should take time yeah yeah literally and i feel  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like people don't talk about that part they don't time either you know they be trying to keep that part  " }, 

{ "sentence": " hitting but yeah yeah yeah and i think i think that's why people really relate to our show too  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because we've always been honest like i keep it real i was like man y'all when i was recording this  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i was broke i didn't have nothing and we are always honest about what's going on and how much like it's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " expensive like the expense like we just are an open book so i like i said i think in the beginning  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like the consistency was hard even still now like we're we're literally i'm not trying to be like oh i'm  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a boss but no i'm literally a boss like i have a staff that i pay period sometimes it'd be months  " }, 

{ "sentence": " where ad checks might be a little low we gotta take a pay cut because they showed up for work they gotta  " }, 

{ "sentence": " get paid regardless you know what i'm saying regardless so it's like so now it's like it's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like a business owner it's like that's the struggle some months you have months where you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " maybe make 60 70k in the month then it may be four months where it's dry yeah it's not always  " }, 

{ "sentence": " gonna be a piece yeah so i think it's like one thing about just like doing a podcast in general  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i think a lot of people look at podcasts because podcasting is so popular now yeah but if you're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " doing this for the money don't don't do it don't do it don't get the money in the beginning yeah  " }, 

{ "sentence": " literally just income it takes time putting all in yes yes yes and it's very important to be on the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " same page with whoever you're doing it with like y'all gotta have that understanding that yeah it's not  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about the money right deeper than just a check yeah it's it's gotta be a little bit of passion  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it has to be passion yeah it's gotta be a little bit of passion behind it for sure i feel like that's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what has kept us going too yeah it's just the passion because at one point we wasn't making money  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and we wasn't really getting along but i feel like we both always wanted to be in the media space  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so we had the passion because we have the same degree too so oh wow yeah yeah and i think that's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " crazy another yeah i think another motivation for me too was like when we went on um tour our first tour  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it was kind of like i was so shocked at how many people were doing meet and greets and they're walking  " }, 

{ "sentence": " up to us like crying like man i'd be so depressed i'd be going through it but every friday i can count  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on y'all to give me a good laugh and i'm like i don't give a damn if 30 000 people talking about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they hate me if i touch one person and like man dre and legs really did this like they came from  " }, 

{ "sentence": " dreya's bedroom floor recording so it's like if you can just touch one person that'll make a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " difference that's all you need that's last story we went on it was a guy in the audience talking about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " how he had cancer he had cancer he was going through chemo and he's like in the bed he was like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " poor minds literally got me through my chemotherapy are you serious he said he used to watch it every  " }, 

{ "sentence": " time he had a chemo appointment yes he was like it was just like so it's like the internet can say  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what they want but i'm talking to i'm touching people in real life like people like y'all can say  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what y'all want y'all can get online and say whatever and like i said i think that's the motivation  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because sometimes we get discouraged because you see all these comments of negativity and just mean  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and like they don't realize that we're humans behind this camera like we're here to entertain  " }, 

{ "sentence": " y'all but i'm a human you know what i'm saying like they forget like because they see you you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know dressed up they see you dressed up and all y'all living this life but y'all are still human  " }, 

{ "sentence": " beings when you're typing that message you're saying it to a human so i think for us it's like the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " motivation is like when we see the listeners in real life and they're like man like y'all really  " }, 

{ "sentence": " changed my life and y'all really have motivated the podcast or that's the reason y'all keep going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " man yes that's what matters yes yes for sure a thousand percent do y'all feel like it's harder  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when people see you guys outside of poor minds and try to like project things that go on in your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " personal life onto the entertaining side of what y'all do like it's like they try to find anything on  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you to take away from dre and nicole or lex like y'all don't have to deal with that like people from  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your hometown people that knew you before this oh it's like they always try to like discredit or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " comfort you and like oh they get so mad that people love y'all and are inspired by y'all it's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like do you have to deal with the scrutiny of people just trying to like take that light away from y'all  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i get what you saying yeah i for sure feel like we have to deal with that to a certain extent it  " }, 

{ "sentence": " was actually like a few years ago somebody had left a comment and i can't even remember honestly  " }, 

{ "sentence": " exactly what they said but it was like somebody i went to high school with and they had left like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a nasty comment under one of our episodes and my thing is i always say this people be trying to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " project a lot but it's really just because people be feeling some type of way that they didn't chase  " }, 

{ "sentence": " their own dream yeah so you can't let that shit get to you or make you feel no type of way because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a lot of the time it's like they wish they could have moved to atlanta they wish they could have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " moved somewhere else and started a podcast or chased their dream and became successful at it and they  " }, 

{ "sentence": " didn't because we all got the same 24 hours and the fact that i come from the same place as you should  " }, 

{ "sentence": " be enough of a testament to show you you could do the same shit right so i try not to let it bother  " }, 

{ "sentence": " me but we definitely get that type of backlash all the time yeah yeah it's crazy because i think we get  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i mean we get a lot of support you know like from yeah but like i said most of the time when we get  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like bookings or people reaching out to us and stuff it'd be like in other cities and stuff oh  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's how it always is yeah so it just it's really crazy to me a lot of people like oh my gosh why  " }, 

{ "sentence": " don't y'all do more stuff in houston i'll be like because people in atlanta they be wanting to see us  " }, 

{ "sentence": " here or they be wanting to see us in birmingham or wherever it's at so um i have learned not to pay  " }, 

{ "sentence": " attention to the people who don't pay attention to me i pay attention to people who love me and support me  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yeah that's the thing that the people that's mad that's who pay the most attention yeah that's true  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i mean it'd be one guy in our comments it was okay y'all i read the comments on youtube especially  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because i i take constructive criticism well so i'm trying to pay attention but it'd be some  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people like this is one person it's like he be tuned in every week and i always see his comments i'm  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like i he realized like you're in love with us and i really thank you because it don't matter but  " },

{ "sentence": " invested into you that shit is scary you know who has that jackie aina the way people treat her the  " },

{ "sentence": " have made that transition from youtube to tick tock that transition was hard for a lot of beauty  " }, 

{ "sentence": " creators yeah so she made that transition successfully so people just feel like they she owes them  " }, 

{ "sentence": " something yeah i think it's so strange how people treat her it's very very weird i didn't what i'll go  " },

{ "sentence": " very good so i'll just say like my only advice i have to give is like i think y'all should get in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the space to where y'all release episodes weekly the podcast space where i think y'all can go because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like y'all literally remind me of how me and dreah first started out because when y'all look at these  " }, 

{ "sentence": " episodes when y'all first start when y'all like two three years in y'all be like oh my god look at where  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we are now this is a skill conversation is a skill it is and y'all are developing it so well  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but the podcast space is they want that content weekly they want that content weekly and i'm  " }, 

{ "sentence": " telling y'all we black women are so behind in this podcasting space it's people that are signing a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " hundred million dollar deals but we have to do the job of consistently doing good content and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " releasing it so we can be there it's a shame that in 2024 poor minds is doing things for the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " first time that other people haven't done before and this kiki palmer is doing things because they're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " not trying to let us in but we are so entertaining we're just as funny as these men if not more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " entertaining girl this girl talk they need this yeah right they need our voices it don't need to be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like oh we got to get more views and act normal we got to get more views than poor minds it's enough  " }, 

{ "sentence": " space for all of us i love that yes so y'all that's the only thing i would say i i want y'all to work  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on releasing every week we're gonna get there our schedules we so busy we got to get into the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " recording recording two episodes so we can have something to lay it later because we're like six  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we're like six episodes in the can yeah so if you want to take off for a month we can't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so that's what i was gonna say too yes but sometimes we record like two we've even recorded  " }, 

{ "sentence": " three episodes in the day before so i feel like if y'all could get that down pack y'all gonna be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " out of here because like lex said a lot of the time with people the thing is out of sight out of mind  " }, 

{ "sentence": " y'all have a large following so people are gonna watch regardless but because y'all have a large  " }, 

{ "sentence": " following that's why people want to see y'all we've been doing this for five six years and no miss no  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like we don't know what we're gonna talk about and then we come up with something yeah so but it's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " okay relationship topics it's what's hot right now we want to talk about it every day yeah every single  " }, 

{ "sentence": " day and i think are just like you said like the growth that i've had but like y'all are gonna go  " }, 

{ "sentence": " through a spurt like even you like saying that that cheating is a deal breaker people are probably  " }, 

{ "sentence": " surprised to hear that from you because you know you went through your situation so publicly but  " }, 

{ "sentence": " girls need to hear that especially these young girls that look up to you so i think it's very  " }, 

{ "sentence": " important to get in front of these cameras and be your authentic self and give the people what they  " }, 

{ "sentence": " need they need y'all and i think too like i want to say this too because i look i get a little  " }, 

{ "sentence": " long-winded now but i told dray this because i watched impact the first season because i'm a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " reality tv head i love reality reality i watch house i hate reality me too i don't watch tv look i watch it  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when i watched impact the first season i was like you know what some spaces aren't for people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and i think like when you went on that show it was like people perceived you how they wanted to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " perceive you but i was like it's that's not her that maybe not be for her but now that you have this  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you can really show people who you are exactly and you can control the narrative yeah i'm not letting  " }, 

{ "sentence": " nobody write my story for me yeah you cannot let people never believe it is not real so now that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " y'all can sit in front of these cameras and really give y'all authentic self like this is your opportunity  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to show the world like y'all are more than what people try to put y'all in this box about right  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and y'all can really be an example for like young girls that look up to y'all for real we want to be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " how do y'all stay so unbiased with this job i feel like by not really giving our opinions  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on certain things like i i like to create a safe space for people to where they feel like they  " }, 

{ "sentence": " could talk about whatever they want to talk about but like if you talking about somebody  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are you talking down on somebody i don't have no comment that ain't got nothing to do with me  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right right speak your peace but hopefully the other party isn't upset that we had you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on the platform but we ain't say though yeah i feel like we dealt with that before so yeah learning  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yeah and i think that that's how it is because it's like you don't have to speak on everything  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and one thing i know this sounds crazy but i literally growing up looked up to oprah  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because she interviews so well but you know one thing oprah did even when she was like before she  " }, 

{ "sentence": " was interviewing all these stars if you watch her interview she would literally be talking to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " racist yeah and she stayed unbiased the good thing about a part a good interviewer is going to stay  " }, 

{ "sentence": " unbiased they're not going to make you feel bad about what you're saying they're not going to impose  " }, 

{ "sentence": " their opinion on you so i think that's one thing like we've learned how to just stay unbiased because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " our platform is for you to come on and speak your truth right it's not it's not yeah so it's like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " literally because i don't give a damn rit do i'll have you on your op gonna be on the show the next  " }, 

{ "sentence": " week right yeah that's just what it's about and we don't really like asking people about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " their personal life or their business like that unless you let us know that you comfortable yeah  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we're talking about it like even if we seen some on a blog and then you coming on the show  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i'm not gonna ask you about that right right i respect that yeah like i'm not trying we're not  " }, 

{ "sentence": " here to embarrass you yeah we want you to have a good time like we all about good times and good vibes  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on our show we like to get a little tipsy and have like real conversations about normal  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like it's not we don't never want it to feel like an interview we want it to be more like we all just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " conversing yeah having a conversation yeah so enough of the last convo we didn't get into a lot  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of things we've been all over the place all over the place all over the place but that's what keep  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it interesting it just flow organically yeah so now let's get into our how to act normal segment where  " }, 

{ "sentence": " y'all send in questions and we answer okay so this week question is how do i tell my best friend that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i don't like her other best friend every time we plan something she always invites her friend and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i'm just not with it oh i would just tell her but my but i i know she didn't give too much context  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but like now i'm wondering why you don't like the friend yeah what the friend be doing what does she  " }, 

{ "sentence": " be doing like do you have a real reason are you just are you just feeling some type of way  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right i wish she would have gave some more context but i feel like honesty is always the best policy just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " keep it moving yeah i'll speak from personal experience her best friend used to hate me  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but it was because like when we were going through our rough patch obviously like you're gonna vent to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your other friends when you and your friend are going to it and going through it and i'm okay with  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that because i've been to her sometimes or whatever the case may be so it was like i finally got to have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a conversation with her and now it's like we see out of out like okay and i think like i said it took that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " growth and i really had to sit down like she was just like we're protective of each other yeah i'm  " }, 

{ "sentence": " protective of her dre is protective of me her friends are protective of her my friends are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " protective of me so it's like when we came together it's like okay y'all and y'all gotta you know what  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i'm saying it was like integrating a family it's like a marriage it's like a marriage it's like a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " marriage so i think for for me i knew what i had to do and it was just like hey let me just have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a conversation i'm like man look i had to tell her girl i'm not out to get your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " girlfriend i love her like you know what i'm saying i think she had to hear it from my mouth  " }, 

{ "sentence": " rather than being like oh hey girl how you doing and like fake hellos and goodbyes so i think with  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a situation like that it's like you really need to get to the root of the problem and i think the root  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of the problem with us is like she just felt like i didn't have good intentions which rightfully so  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because the things that we used to be going through i wasn't mad at her for feeling that way  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i never was mad at her for feeling that way i knew why she felt that way because we used to get into  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it so bad so i knew for me it was okay for me to like let my guard down and be like hey  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i ain't i ain't getting me here you know what i'm saying so i think whatever the situation she's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " going through you need to get to the root of the problem and see if they can work it out together  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because i had a conversation with her without dreah around she did yeah like i had a conversation  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with her like one-on-one so yeah i think that's what it takes sometimes how do you how do you feel  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about um i'm gonna just speak from like my pov i when my friend has a friend i don't feel like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i even get in the space of like trying to too much to be on some i don't like her  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know like this is somebody that my friend likes you know if you ain't on no 100 like obviously you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " not on no because my friend like you so i'm gonna just try to embrace you it ain't about how i feel  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like it's i'm not here to try to make my friend uncomfortable around her other friend you know what  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i'm saying so it's like even if i don't like you it's not about me right yeah i feel you you know  " }, 

{ "sentence": " i feel like our situation should get that on you i wouldn't be like oh i don't like her so you don't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " need to be around her yeah i think with me and des we hold each other to such a certain standard  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yeah so it's not really like a friend thing it's like you my sister so anybody else we bring around  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they know it's not going to be the dynamic me and her so it's never really in debate of like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " oh i don't like her yeah it don't have to be that because it's like people know yeah that  " },

{ "sentence": " And it doesn't necessarily mean.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like it's not one person comparing to the other.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like it's just a general thing to do.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And that's what, that's one thing that I was like always saying something about was  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like the comparing because it's like, I've been alive for 22 years, never once woke up  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and seen a picture of her and said, Oh, I want to do this.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Cause she's doing it very pretty girl.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Nothing physically wrong with her, but I just, just never did it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So I just don't think that should be being said.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And, um, I do want to think that was like, no, that was like very mature, right?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That was like a very like broad, regular statement.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It wasn't like an attack or anything.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Right.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " People, let's get one thing straight.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But I'm obsessed.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " No, I don't, you're not obsessed.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because everyone in my fucking thing, I was literally on live with my daughter in the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " pool and people were like, you know, you were copying her with that blonde hair.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I was like, social media is always going like, okay.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's almost like a telenovela, right?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like it's like a reality TV show to them.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " They, you are so, we, all of us, like all three of us are just an unobtainable thing.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like we are not going to ever be like the common friend to them.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So like for them, seeing you as their reality TV, reality TV, there's drama.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " They want something to spark.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " They're going to continue to try and ride this story out for the next five years.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm with you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm done talking about it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Cause it's like, if I'm obsessed, then why every, I could post a picture of a fucking  " }, 

{ "sentence": " unicorn wall and they're going to say something, whether it's you're better than her or something  " }, 

{ "sentence": " negative towards me about her.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, but I'm the one, like, I am a very defensive person.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like I do it with my family.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I do it with my friends.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I do it on the internet.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That is just me.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's a shitty fucking quality to have as a famous person because you're supposed to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " not say anything, not reply to comments, not this, not that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And it's, it's not that I'd be hurt or that I'd be upset.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's more that I'd be like, cause it really, yeah, let me check you real quick and make  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you feel dumb.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That's what it be.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That's why it's so weird to me.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, but people don't see that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " They just see, uh, she's mad.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " We got her mad or she's obsessed.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I'm gonna be honest.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's not like that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, I know this was a very like personal situation.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's just the quality I have and I do it with everything.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, okay, you see me saying something about her, but I'm still addressing shit from  " }, 

{ "sentence": " 1894 too, like, you're addressing Christopher Columbus.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " He's addressing 19, I'm still trying to figure out when he sailed the ocean blue, bitch.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, he's trying to fact check when the fuck that happened.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Cause did it happen?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I feel you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's a, anything you do, it'll always be negative.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, they're, they're just grasping this one thing I'm doing when I'm doing it  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with 35 other things too.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, it's not that I'm just a very, especially with that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I have way more stories to tell, way more things I haven't said.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, it's like, I'm, I'll, and first of all, bitch, you talked about my kid.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Do you think I'm ever going to be done?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I mean, I don't personally know what that feels like.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then people want to say, people want to say, oh, she, you, you talked about her family.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " She talked about yours.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I talked about grown ass adults.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " No, to be fair, I talked about her family.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I talked about her mother.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I talked about adults.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You talked about.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I mean, a child.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I see what you're saying.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I see the comparison.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " A child that wasn't even one yet.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I understand.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That can't even talk.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Or defend herself.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So back.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then what she said was so crazy.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Which, which part?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " She said, she said, fuck it for a bag.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Now you hear Callie.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, what do you think he was doing with you?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Talking about LaVon.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I actually don't even know, like, the true, let me, let's go back.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Okay.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, let's, let's take this all the way back.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The reason I got involved, okay, is because the, the clips were going viral, the TMZ article,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and I was like, oh, this is crazy.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You know?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Someone commented under my TikTok and was like, yo, you should add Bama to the bop house.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And let me tell you why they said that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The bop house is known, you know, like, basically to not sugarcoat it, a bunch of whores in a house.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Okay, so, they were like, yo, it was a diss at Bama.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " They were being funny.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " They were trying to be funny, right?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " They were being funny.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And you kind of just were like, I would never.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah, like, it was a funny thing for me.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I was like, yo, like, I'm not with the homewrecking shit.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " She saw it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Me, I'm an entrepreneur, I'm a CEO, I'm that bitch.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " When it comes to making my bag, I'm gonna make my bag.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Okay?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, I saw it as an opportunity.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I was like, yo, bet.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then I started digging.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then the second I opened my mouth about the situation, it was many other women.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It was many other things.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The story wasn't horrible, right?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But it's not like, I don't want people, like, me and you weren't friends or weren't speaking before this situation.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It wasn't like I was standing up for my best friend.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, it was just like, hey, this is a situation that's genuinely wrong.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It was a principle, yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's a genuinely wrong situation regardless of how it's spinned.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So, let me just make a quick joke out of it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " They were being funny.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You were being funny.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I was being funny.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It wasn't even nothing.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It wasn't even nothing serious until it got serious.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And until she brought up the fact that I was this porn star, right?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, I was this, like, disgusting whore prostitute.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, she would rather be a Nepo baby than an OF baby, which is, like, cool.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " She was posting naked pictures, posting shit, like, shit worse than we would post for free.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And we were making money from it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I just thought it was a low blow.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, I really did.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I understand she was upset.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I understand my position in a sense of I could have just shut the fuck up and kept it pushing.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But for me, it was all, like, it was a marketing strategy and it worked as far as, like, but  " }, 

{ "sentence": " at the end of the day, like, it was a fucked up situation.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The more that came out about it, the more, because I feel like you weren't even really  " }, 

{ "sentence": " talking about it until you saw I got pressed and you were like, oh, bet, like, she's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " now going to say something.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, let me just hop on it, too.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But I want to go back to, like, you guys were once friends, and before the cameras were  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on, she was saying, like, it wasn't even, like, a friend.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It was, like, that's someone that you said you considered to be, like, a little sister.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah, she was, like, a little sister.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, okay, so I want people to understand that she is going to try to downplay it as  " }, 

{ "sentence": " much as humanly possible because of what she did.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, even though, oh, we weren't even friends like that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Oh, we weren't, if I would, if it was even just Instagram friends, you still shouldn't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have done me like that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I mean, it's a common principle.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " If you know a woman has a man, you don't do that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yes, that's what I was about to say.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Beyond it being her friend, you don't do that to a woman that is with a man, point blank,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " period.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But it being your friend makes it, like, 45 times worse.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But what I was telling Camilla was, it's, like, way worse because this girl was, like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a little sister to me.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, I don't, I don't consider many people my friends.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So, it was, like.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It hurt a little more.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It just, it was, like, the twist.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I, no, don't get me wrong.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm not the, like, we weren't, like, hang out every day.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, no, we weren't.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I don't think you're that type of person anyway to hang out with any, you don't hang out  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with anybody every day.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I was, I'm not that type of person.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, I, like, I text, I call, I hang out, whatever.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But it's not, like, an everyday thing with me.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Even with my closest of friends.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I probably, the most time I spend is probably with my daughter and my boyfriend.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, because they live in my house.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I have no choice.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, you know, like, it's not, it's not that kind.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, I'm literally the type of person that, like, chill in my room all day.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I don't really be outside.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So, she could downplay it saying, like, oh, we weren't everyday friends.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But it's like, bitch, I've never been everyday friends with anybody in my life.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So, whatever.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But I don't consider many people my friends.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I considered her, out of all people, I considered her a close friend at that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, we would tell each other our business.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, you know.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And did you ever, that leads perfectly into, like, do you think she was a true friend?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Or did you have any doubts about her at all?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, did you have doubts given, did she have a pattern?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I remember one time I told her, like, oh, you should talk to this boy.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then, like, I remember a couple days later, she asked me to hit him up for her.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then a couple days later, I called her and I was like, girl, he got a girlfriend.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And she was like, so?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I was with my friend Talon and we looked at each other, like, and we tried to, like, explain to her, like, you know, like, that's not cute.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, we don't do stuff like that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then it was funny because later on when I was going back and forth for her, she tried to tell me that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And you went back and forth about it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Bro, we used to all be on group FaceTime.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Oh, wow.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, like, meet her and LeVon.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So, I was, like, okay, so back to that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I was, I was trying to, like, I would try to, like, advise her.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, I remember her coming to me, telling me all these stories about all these older guys she was sleeping with.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And it was, like, back to back.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And it was, like, three in one day.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And it was, like, I just used to be so, like, upset by it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, it wasn't.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So, as a friend, it would consume you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, you'd be, like, like, as a friend, you're trying to help her and be, like, hey, like, why are you doing this?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, this wasn't, this was, like, you were constantly upset about things she was doing because you didn't feel it was right.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Before any of this happened.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It used to just, like, because I done been there done that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yes, I slept with older guys when I was younger, whatever.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But, like, just, I, one thing I'll say about myself is I was always, nothing makes it right.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But I was always more mature for my age.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I could hold an adult conversation.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I would, like, you know, I, you'd get around me and forget I was my age.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So, for her, she acts younger than what she is.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So, it just makes it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What's that?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's, like, ugh, like.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That's just a difference in personality.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's, like.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Or maybe a difference in how you guys were raised.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Exactly.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because I'm going to say this, and I truly, like, believe this, like, and you said it even earlier, like, she's genuinely beautiful.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, like, she's not, like, an ugly, like, she has a, she's absolutely stunning.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yes, even when she takes off her makeup, she's pretty.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And that's one thing I cannot say, like, she's not.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But that's what confuses me is, like.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " She's beautiful.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Why does she, what is, this girl is trying to cover up so many things.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And she's trying to, like, within herself.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's, like, and then she tries to find herself through other people.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think she just sits there and thinks.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " She just, she looks at, like, all, like, when I think of it, I have, like, a very creative, imaginative mind.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I just see her in front of a wall with all these pictures of all these different girls.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And, like, oh, if I had this from them, and if I had this from them, and if I had this from them, and I'd be perfect.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That's really sad, though.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It is.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Okay, I'm going to tell you a story.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I, I don't even think I told LV this.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because I was on ecstasy with Talon and some other friends, and she came up in conversation.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And one of the boys I was with, he was, like, you know, she tried to talk to me, and I almost went for it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I, I didn't, I didn't know her age.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And as soon as somebody told me her age, I was, like, creeped out.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I, like, couldn't sit with myself for a second.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, and he was, like, thank God I never did anything with her.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I never even met up with her.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And the conversation just, I wasn't telling her business or anything.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But, like, the conversation just got so deep, I started to cry about her.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because I was just, like, it's sad.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It is.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's, like, it's really sad.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I just feel, like.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because it, sorry, you made me cry.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because it hits deeper because you have a daughter.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah, it's just, like, like, she's got to be looking for something.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, it's empty.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And a part of me almost wishes that she would have asked me for help.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Rather than to think she was going to find it in the ways that she did.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Especially to me.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I totally hear you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think even, like, for myself, too.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, us specifically.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, working in the industry and, like, having a relationship.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, you are constantly comparing yourself.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " At least me.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, I can speak for myself.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " There are a lot of things I'm insecure about.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You know, like, you look at these beautiful women, you know.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And you realize, like, damn, like, I do wish I had a fatter ass.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Or, you know, like, maybe, like, this industry really fucks with your head.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I promise you, like, I struggle with it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So, like, I can't imagine, like, she comes from, like, a very wealthy family.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " She's, Bama, this is one thing I'll say.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, bitch, you're beautiful.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, you are beautiful.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And, like, this is, like, girl to girl.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, I understand what it's like to, like, constantly compare yourself to people around you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But you have to remember she didn't have her mom in house.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I actually don't know Bama's story.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah, she didn't have her mom in house.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So, I mean, I don't know exactly her relationship with her mother.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But I just know that, you know, Travis raised her.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Every time I was around, I've never met her mother.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Every time I was around, she never really spoke of her mother.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And, like, if I'm around somebody, they see me call my mom at least four or six times in one hour.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah, I'm really close with my family.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So, you know, like, it was just.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Can't AI community?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " No. What are you going to have? I mean, maybe, maybe.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " A zillion bots in a.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah, yeah, exactly. One guy, one guy and a thousand bots that are all doing it. Maybe  " }, 

{ "sentence": " GPT 10 can do that or whatever, but the next, this interquartile period, whatever we're coming  " }, 

{ "sentence": " up to is the easiest way to, to hedge against automation, I think is to focus on community.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " All right, next one. If you can be in a bad mood for no reason, you might as well be in a good mood  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for no reason. If it's not going to change your life, it shouldn't change your mood. If the cost  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is peace of mind, don't buy it. Yeah, if you can be in a bad mood for no reason, then you can be in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a good mood for no reason. Which means that if you can do something that's amazing and still have a shit  " }, 

{ "sentence": " day, it means you can do something that sucks and have a good day. Which means the entire excuse  " }, 

{ "sentence": " around, I don't want to do all these hard things because as a proxy, it makes my mood sad  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is ridiculous. Because it means that we are ultimately in control of how we want to perceive  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the work that we do. And so I think that is ultimately the most freeing thing that you can  " }, 

{ "sentence": " do in terms of how you can equip yourself to get through those harder periods.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Why do you think there's so much cynicism at the moment, especially on the internet?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's easier. You can always defend no. We actually deal with this a lot at acquisition.com from an  " }, 

{ "sentence": " investment perspective. And we actually have to check ourselves, which is it's always easy to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " find a reason not to do an investment. So we have a no bias. And you should have, I mean, you should  " }, 

{ "sentence": " overall have a no bias. Like you should say, okay, here's all the things that could go wrong. And you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have to kind of think that way because you have to manage risk. But if you say no to everything,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're always right in the short term. But if you never make an investment, you're wrong in the one  " }, 

{ "sentence": " way that matters, which is you get no return. And so like you always miss the short term losses,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but you lose the big long term gain. And so it's, again, this is a continuum to be managed more than  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a problem to be solved. But cynicism is short term. It's like every, so when you, so, okay,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this is, so when you go home, right, and you want to start a new business, or you have a girl that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're bringing back, and your friends and your family are like, she's not going to last, or like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this isn't going to, this isn't going to be forever. They are right. Literally, every single  " }, 

{ "sentence": " time, except for the one time you bring your wife home. And in that time, they're all wrong. And it's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the one time that fucking matters. And so the idea, like, but the thing is, is because of the false  " }, 

{ "sentence": " positives or the true positives, they might have been right literally 19 out of 20 times. And if  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they were right the first time and the second time and the third time and the fourth time, why would  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they bet against no on the fifth time or the 50th time? But you only need one yes or one positive  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to change your entire life. And so there's this habit, and that's where cynicism comes from,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " where we get so many positive reinforcers for saying no and being right. But it's only short term  " }, 

{ "sentence": " being right, because you have to make big bets to win big. And that also means that you're wrong  " }, 

{ "sentence": " plenty of times, and people aren't willing to look stupid for being wrong. This school bet could go  " }, 

{ "sentence": " wrong. I'm betting it's not. But everything has risk. And I've been public about it. Right? And so  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like, if anything, but like, I've played this out. So like, I like, I'll tell you how I played this  " }, 

{ "sentence": " out. I was like, if it goes wrong, I'll document the things that I that I learned, and then I'll  " }, 

{ "sentence": " apply next time. And I'll do what I've always done. State the facts and tell the truth.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It is strange to think about how  " }, 

{ "sentence": " being cynical, or skeptical, or kind of sardonic or cutting or aloof.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's used as a proxy for being smart.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Oh, okay.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The worst thing that anybody could be accused of is naive. That's what they're trying to optimize  " }, 

{ "sentence": " against. They don't want to be seen as naive. Oh, you fucking you hope that everything was going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to be good. Oh, that's, I mean, that's cute. Like, you know, the world will teach you it'll  " }, 

{ "sentence": " don't worry, don't worry. It's like, it'll, you'll learn, you'll learn. Yeah, people don't want to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " be naive. And they'll be right. And that's what's that's what's painful, is that it takes more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " effort to start in the beginning. And more people are right about the fact they're like, hey, you're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " not going to hit it big. And guess what, a month in, you're not, but they're only measuring on  " }, 

{ "sentence": " months. And it's six months, you're also not going to hit it big yet. And they're going to be like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm still fucking right. And at a year, you're still not going to hit it big. And they'll still be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " fucking right. And every day that you haven't hit it, they're going to feel like they were right.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But they're wrong. Because they're measuring in days, and you're measuring in decades.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " There's this idea from Gwenda called the cynical genius illusion. Cynical people are seen to be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " smarter, but sizable research suggests they actually tend to be dumber. Cynicism is not a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " sign of intelligence, but a substitute for it. A way to shield oneself from betrayal and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " disappointment without having to actually think. There was a there's a tweet on a doomsday money  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Twitter guy. And he said, Yeah, he's predicted 16 out of the last three recessions.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And the thing is, is that no one, no one recalls the other 13 times that guy was wrong.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And they don't recall all of the gains that probably were made in the marketplace  " }, 

{ "sentence": " by people who didn't sell during that time period. There was this  " }, 

{ "sentence": " broad, you know, people forward shit on WhatsApp. And if it's been forward lots of times, it even  " }, 

{ "sentence": " says at the top forwarded many times. It's like a little warning. And this happened, I think, around  " }, 

{ "sentence": " COVID. There was an image of one guy, one squaddy wearing army gear walking through the streets of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " London. And this was forwarded on WhatsApp as evidence that the army was going to come and hold  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people in the house at gunpoint. And if you left, it was going to be martial law was going to be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " deployed on the streets of London. And this went fucking nuclear, completely interstellar, absolutely  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everywhere. What happened with that? What happened with what happened with that thing? Not a single  " }, 

{ "sentence": " person who decided to spout this half fucking baked opinion that never turned out to be true  " }, 

{ "sentence": " ever got held to account for that. And I must have received that message like five times.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, hey, you don't get to just make these like, ridiculous, like, actually stupid fucking claims  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about the world. And then no one called you to account.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm going to hit on the cynicism point. The world belongs to optimists. Because if you're going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to do anything big, you have to believe that it can happen. Otherwise, it never will.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That's Sean Puri thing. The cynics get to be right and the optimists get to be rich.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. Like, if you look at it from a percentage of success rate, I've been wrong more times than  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I've been right. I've failed more times than I've succeeded. But you always succeed more and are right  " }, 

{ "sentence": " more in the big ways than the people who've been right all along and are wrong. Trevor says this,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " my editor. He says, 99% right and 100% wrong. So like, they're right 99% of the time. But they're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " wrong 100% because the only thing that matters is the big one at the end. Like, your family and friends  " }, 

{ "sentence": " will say that every girl that you ever date is not good enough. Except for the one time you find the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " girl that you're actually going to marry. And then it doesn't matter. Or like, this won't last.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Or like, this business idea. It's not going to work. And you might have nine failures. I felt my  " }, 

{ "sentence": " first nine businesses didn't really amount to anything. Nine. Nine. As in the first one,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " spent time, fucking failed. Second one, this one will be different. Fucking failed. Third one,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this one, this is the one. And then seven, six more after that. Right? I'm just painting this picture  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because like, it's painful as shit because the whole time everyone is telling you, I told you so.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And they're right. Today. But not forever. If the cost is peace of mind, don't buy it. Why?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I use the peace of mind as a, as a indicator for breaching values. So that's the, I want to become  " }, 

{ "sentence": " known rather than, and sacrifice my reputation in order to do so. And so for me, I would lose peace  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of my life, like right on the edge. I'm like, I don't know, this is a little bit edgy. I had a guy  " }, 

{ "sentence": " who shared a bash clip of me. And what's a bash clip? Oh, like somebody like took my clip and then  " }, 

{ "sentence": " was like, this is wrong. And, and so I looked at the guy's profile and I saw he was a VC and I was  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like, huh? Okay. I know who this is. Oh. And so I DM'd him and I was like, do you disagree with this?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And, uh, he said something. And then I just eviscerated him. Uh, and he was like, you're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right. I overstepped because I wanted to try and do a viral clip. You are fundamentally right. And  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I was wrong. And so like, that is what I would never want to be like. That is disgusting to me.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so the cost of making a viral clip to try and trend jump when I know that fundamentally the thing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " isn't right is not worth the price. There's a, this shows up in, in other ways. So I had to,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what the fuck did I do? I, I think I tried to throw a used splendor packet in a bin in a restaurant,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know, like, yeah, did that, but I was leaving and I was like, it's next to the bin. Someone will  " }, 

{ "sentence": " get it. And I walked. Oh yeah. 30 yards away. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. Turned around, went back,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " put it in the bin. Yeah. You'd know, that's the peace of mind. Yeah. And this is another one of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " those interesting reframes. This is really, really interesting to me. If the cost is peace of mind,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " don't buy it. You can see, and I did for a long time, my inability to move in as ruthless of a way  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as I, as other people do as a weakness, as a vulnerability. And I realized in retrospect that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's just a higher standard that I'm holding myself to. And that can be, that will result in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " many times me doing things that, and, and, and having things that I need to overcome. I'm working  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on my people pleasing tendencies as hard as I can at the moment. To not? To not. Yeah. I, I end up,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I don't like to disappoint people. I don't like to do things that causes other people to feel bad or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " feel hurt or to tell them things that they don't want to hear. That's why that Dr. Robert Glover,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the no more Mr. Nice guy was just so fucking like very, very, very incisive.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Uh, but I realized even with that, I had, I had a conversation with a friend and it's to do with  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this book. And there's a bunch of ideas that everybody's been working on in my friend group  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for quite a while. And I was like, I really want to write about this thing and sent him a long,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " overly arduous voice note explaining about how conflicted I was because it's not my idea. Now,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " no one owns the truth. That's one of the brilliant things about working through quotes and things  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like this is no one owns it, right? Like if it's accurate, nobody gets to own the truth.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's just an insight about the way that reality exists. So I sent him this big, long voice note  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and he replied to me and said, and I, in it, I'm over pattern matching. A lot of the things I'm  " }, 

{ "sentence": " doing is people pleasing. Like it's the, I think I sent you that tweet about, um, I just learned  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about the recency bias. And of all of them, I have to say it's my favorite one. So you see this new  " }, 

{ "sentence": " thing and it's the hot new toy that you're playing with or whatever, the like shiny new toy. And, uh,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " he responded and he said, uh, I wanted to say how grateful I am that you in amongst all of the stuff  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and the book and the show and all of the different people pulling on your attention, that the first  " }, 

{ "sentence": " place that you would go to when thinking about this idea is how I would feel rather than how you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " can like wheedle it so that you get the outcome that you want or whatever. Uh, I would be very  " }, 

{ "sentence": " hesitant in you saying, are you calling that people pleasing when it's one of the reasons that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I love you as a friend. I was like, huh, that's interesting. That's a reframe that I hadn't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " anticipated. And that is again, the peace of mind thing. Now your level for peace of mind may be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " different to somebody else's, but I don't think that that's something that you should be ashamed of.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You know, as a fun challenge for anyone who's listening, try telling the truth  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in social settings. So when someone invites you to a party, instead of coming up with a fake excuse  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that you both know is a fake excuse, just say, I don't want to go. Really fuck with you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Um, and if someone like says, Hey, can you, uh, you know, help me move? You're like, I don't want  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to. It's very freeing because the thing is, is that like their response is on them. And if I just,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I try and anchor myself to truth. If I just tell the truth and state the facts, I'm good with me.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And if someone, and I asked them, cause I had a exchange recently where I said that, um, I say it  " }, 

{ "sentence": " often. And now people who are around me are accustomed to the fact that I will just state the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " facts and tell the truth. Um, I said, would you have preferred that I've lied to you? And the guy  " }, 

{ "sentence": " just, I was like, so you would prefer that I lie. I will not be associated with someone who would  " }, 

{ "sentence": " prefer that I lied to them. Cause it makes my life difficult because then I'd have to lie,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " which then would breach one of my, my values. So in the future, you know, I, I had someone  " }, 

{ "sentence": " who, um, recently was like, Hey, um, Hey, if you need anything, you know, let me know how  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I can help. I'd be like, you don't mean that. Cause if I actually need something, you will  " }, 

{ "sentence": " not help. And so it's, it's really uncomfortable for a lot of people because it, it breaks a lot  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of social norms. But I think that learn, it's kind of like the hundred knows is like being  " }, 

{ "sentence": " comfortable. Like it's just being comfortable with the truth. And the truth is,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is one of the scariest, ugliest things, you know, like, why don't you want to go on another  " }, 

{ "sentence": " day with me? I don't like you. You're not worthy, but like people are so uncomfortable with  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that. And I think that the, the, I've just tried to shed bullshit as much as I could for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " my life. And it's just made thinking a lot easier and also dealing with relationships  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a lot easier because you also, by shedding social niceties, when you do also state the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " truth, when I say, I think you fucking killed that people know it fucking carries weight  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because you don't just say that. And so I would say most of my team, for example, if  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I pay a compliment, they know that I mean it. And I don't have to say like, Hey, like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if I'm being honest, I really be like, I don't have to, I don't like, and it makes your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " words mean what you say. And I think that is like, I aspire to be a man who, when I say  " }, 

{ "sentence": " things, people know that I mean them. And I think a way to do that is to stop saying things  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that I don't mean. And so I'm trying to cut as much of the words that are niceties and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " things that I don't mean and are nonsensical and bullshit that I've been taught to say in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this social situation, when someone says that makes sense, I say, no, it doesn't make any  " }, 

{ "sentence": " sense. People are like, Oh, um, because when, when someone says makes sense at the end of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a sentence, we are trained to just nod and say, yeah, yeah. Even though if you didn't even  " }, 

{ "sentence": " process it, but if I don't think it makes sense, I say, no, I don't think it makes sense or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " no, I don't understand. And again, you don't want to look stupid, but looking stupid in the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " moment so that you can better understand something makes you not look stupid for the rest of your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " life when you actually understand it. And so I've just, that has been a huge effort of mine is to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " make, make words great again. Um, make words mean what they mean again.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. And I, and I, and I really, I, I spirited that with my writing and I, and especially in my  " }, 

{ "sentence": " social relationship because time is so valuable when we have so, so little of it. And I don't want to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " waste any of it pretending to be someone or say things that I don't mean.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " misunderstood? Great. You're human. You don't need medication.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I have a huge vehement distaste for, uh, mental medication. And I think one is because it's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " over-prescribed too, because people over WebMD themselves and fundamentally people find a problem  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with being human. And I think a lot of that is because of the social norm that we should be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " never hungry, never sad, never angry, never frustrated, never feel like we're misunderstood.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And those are the, those are the troughs and peaks of humanity. And we can't only wish for sunny days  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because otherwise we'd have droughts and no one, everyone would die. And so it's wishing for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " something that isn't true and will never happen. It's wanting a lie, which is why I'm so against it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Now, are there people who they can test their neurology and whatever? Maybe, but like, honestly,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a hundred years ago, this shit didn't exist. And people just dealt with life. And I think people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " were happier then than they are now. And so clearly this solution hasn't been much of a solution at all.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I, if I, I, you know, I try to have, I don't have that many extreme stance. Well, maybe I do,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but one of my extreme stances is that there is nothing wrong with you. Because even if there is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " something wrong with you, how do you benefit by saying there is something wrong with you? And  " }, 

{ "sentence": " then accepting that label onto yourself. Because the alternative to that is accepting your current  " }, 

{ "sentence": " existence as maybe this is better than everyone else's. And I'm just choosing to believe that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's wrong. And all of this is around some big, mighty should that we think, and that we worship,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that it should, that we should be a certain way that we're not. And I think that discrepancy,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that word, I've tried to eliminate as much as humanly possible from my vocabulary. Cause like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I shouldn't, what I should, nothing according to whom, why should I be happier? Why should I be,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have less anxiety? Why should I feel more understood? And so like pretty much the beginning  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of every ad for like Levitra or whatever, you know, whatever the new serotonin, you know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " SSRI thing is, it's like, they describe humanity. They just say like, are you hungry? Are you tired?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Are you horny? Are you like, are you dissatisfied in any way? Well, the cure of that is a pill,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " which I wholeheartedly decry anything that gives it if then statement for happiness.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So like, you will own nothing and be happy. Like, you want to say that you're going to change my  " }, 

{ "sentence": " external condition to change how I feel. I just, I just reject it as a, as any kind of, if then I'll  " }, 

{ "sentence": " be happy. But like the pill, the over medication part, I am, I've had too many people too close to me  " }, 

{ "sentence": " ruin their lives, topping from SSRI, SSRI and getting on cocktails of pills and on,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and they've got a sleep med and they've got a wake up med and they're just, they're just a walking  " }, 

{ "sentence": " pharmacy. It's crazy for people who aren't American to look at the way that America deals with this.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I remember, so in the UK, just for context, you can't get prescribed melatonin. You can't buy it  " }, 

{ "sentence": " over the counter. You can't buy it on Amazon. My video guy, when he flies over here, takes it back  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like some, like he's fucking smuggling, like he's like Pablo Escobar, but with melatonin tablets  " }, 

{ "sentence": " instead, like going into CVS. Am I allowed to get this? That's the degree of difficulty  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that it is to get prescribed anything. And in America, the first place that people term when  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they have a problem is the pill bottle. I mean, I have two physician parents. So like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and I would say Western, you know, for the most part, Western medicine through the just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " belief in all pharmaceuticals and all that kind of stuff. And so I've, I grew up really close to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it. My grandfather is a physician. So like just lots of medic, medicine in the family in general.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I, I just hate it. I really do. I don't hate a lot of things, but I really, I really, I hate,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I hate what it does to people. And more, the underlying thing is that they reject being human  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and they think there's something wrong with them. And so many people waste all of their time  " }, 

{ "sentence": " trying to solve a problem that is life rather than living it. And it drives me nuts.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like they, they, they, they search for the medication rather than confronting the problem.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like you don't have an anxiety problem. You need to deal with whatever the thing you're worried  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about is. Like, I mean, man, I have too many controversial beliefs. I'm getting into too much  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of it. It's like, you drink a lot because you're stressed. If you deal with the thing that stresses  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you, that's the trigger for you drinking. So yes, there's addictive properties to drinking. I'm not  " }, 

{ "sentence": " going to, I'm not denying that, but the thing that leads to the drinking, the condition that creates  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that, that's something that you can attack. And so I think so little attention is given to accepting  " }, 

{ "sentence": " reality rather than saying there's something wrong that people waste their entire lives searching  " }, 


{ "sentence": " If you knew what you were doing, then you would be stagnating because you'd be doing nothing new.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so if you're going to do something new, then that is what would be the catalyst for growth.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so you can't want to grow and also want to know everything you're doing at the same time.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like the two beliefs contradict one another. And so I think that's a lot of, a lot of the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " discontent that people suffer from is they want two things that are polar opposites.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " They want the really strong character. They want the easy life. Like one is the price of the other.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You have a hard life to have great character. You have an easy life. You have shitty character.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Everything came easy. You want to grow. You don't want hardship. Hardship creates growth.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so they want both and you can't like, it's wanting the Jordans without paying the price.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And the price isn't bad. It's just the price is what it is. And so it's just, do you want the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Jordans or not? And if you do, then don't lament the price tag, pay the price tag and be happy you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have the Jordans. And if you don't want the Jordans, then don't buy them.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " There's something in here is around comparing the lessons that people who have achieved success tell  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you about how to also achieve success when they're using that pattern, which is, well,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they look like they know what they're doing. I should look like I know what I'm doing. I should  " }, 

{ "sentence": " feel like I know what I'm doing. But you don't know what you're doing. You're a white belt and that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " person's a third degree black belt in whatever it is that you're trying to pursue. State the facts  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and tell the truth. I mean, the amount of, you know, 900 follower Instagram accounts that all I see  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is people espousing advice on how to grow their social media following.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You're never going to win. Like you don't get it. Like I've been following, like you don't get it  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because the content of what you're putting out, sorry, the evidence that encapsulates your message  " }, 

{ "sentence": " disproves literally everything you say before you open your mouth. And the thing is, is that people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are obsessing about the algorithm and this type of font and I should do vertical format and I should  " }, 

{ "sentence": " do horizontal format. And I use this as an analogy or that you can draw to anything, but everyone has  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that friend who is a train wreck on relationships who gives relationship advice. It's just like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it doesn't even matter if the advice is good. You're a train wreck. It's the fat friend who gives advice  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on how to be fit. It's just like, and they're like citing all these studies and you should try these  " }, 

{ "sentence": " supplements. It's like, you're a fat fuck. Just shut up. Stop. Like there's don't waste  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your breath. No one is listening. And so it's just, it's missing the big obvious thing.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so again, it's like that big domino. And you're like, I want to get into fitness. Like there  " }, 

{ "sentence": " was a friend of mine actually, um, who's in the fitness space. And he's like, I really want to grow  " }, 

{ "sentence": " my fitness business. And obviously like I have books on it and I have videos and did that for a whole  " }, 

{ "sentence": " past life. And, um, I was like, dude, you're not in shape. He's like, but I know all these, I was  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like, you don't look like someone that anyone wants to look like.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so the thing is like, for whatever you're doing, the big one thing is like, if you were  " }, 

{ "sentence": " looked like a shredded God, you could say eat fried chicken every day and people would buy your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " shit. Cause like, what's the one big domino that if I just did that, everything else would take care  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of itself. Do that. And every ounce of effort you're putting into not doing that is a waste.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Basically the V shred model.  " },

{ "sentence": " What was your definition of trauma that you taught me on the phone?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Oh yeah. So, um, because this word is so thrown around on social media, my God. Um, I was like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " okay, I have to define this so that I can try and like understand it. Um, so I believe trauma is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when you have a punishing event that permanently changes behavior.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That's it. So if you, uh, you know, are a kid and you touch the stove and you burn your hand  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and you never touch the stove again, you were traumatized. Now the thing is, is that that's a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " positive consequence. So is trauma bad? I don't know. Was the consequence bad in that situation?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " No. And so a lot of people use the, this person traumatized me as the, as the, the transgression.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Whereas the question is, what was the result of that quote trauma? Because trauma is just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " accelerated learning. And so if you have PTSD, for example, if you were abroad and had lots of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " bombs going off, then you had rapid learning. So you have trauma that permanently changes your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " behavior around loud noises. And so you generalize loud noises from this environment to now when  " }, 

{ "sentence": " someone honks, you, you know, freak out and you think about those situations. Right. And so  " }, 

{ "sentence": " just defining the world around me has helped me navigate it a lot better so that I can understand  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what we're talking about. Cause there are so many, you know, like trauma is a feeling in your body  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that you have to, you have to release the trauma. I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You don't release trauma. You change behavior due to a stimulus. That's it. And so if you want to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " change your behavior back, you create a new condition that reinforces the new behavior you want,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " period. Cause otherwise we appeal to mysticism and we just say a lot of like nonsensical bullshit  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that the whole world is all about. I actually spoke a woo-woo event, which was really funny.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " How did that go? Uh, surprisingly well, I just started by being like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you will all disagree with most of the things I say, but they, uh, they kind of mysticized my,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " my nihilism. So it worked out fine. How do you do that?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Uh, well, because I just described actions. And so they described those actions as attraction  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for whatever. And I was like, attract, repel, whatever. If you, you know, make a hundred calls,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you'll have more people who know who you are than if you don't.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That's the same as putting out an energetic frequency to the quantum realm.  " },

{ "sentence": " I have no idea what any of that means.  " },

{ "sentence": " community, the education to help you. And so we've actually created a whole thing where people can  " }, 

{ "sentence": " start all this stuff for free. Um, because I just, I believe my whole platform has been  " }, 

{ "sentence": " education. That's what I believe in. Um, I think the education system is broken and, um, teachers  " }, 

{ "sentence": " don't get paid or given the resources to actually teach students in there, you know, they're supposed  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to teach tests that they know don't help students. Students get educated on stuff that doesn't matter  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in the real world. And they go into amounts of debt for a piece of paper that doesn't make them  " }, 

{ "sentence": " anything to pay off the debt that they're in for the rest of their lives. And I just, I hate all of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it, which is why we started making the content that we do. And so, um, this is one big investment that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm doing to try and make my small dent towards helping fix that. And I don't like, I obviously talk  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about business. That's what I know. Okay. Um, but one person can't, can't do that. Like I can't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " change. I mean, I can try, you know, but like, I, I don't, I don't think one, one person's  " },

{ "sentence": " Ben Franklin said, there's no more high, there's no more noble, a deed than to help another know  " }, 

{ "sentence": " more to educate. And I, I wholeheartedly believe that. And so, um, I mean, that's what I'm  " },

{ "sentence": " What's happening from a neuroscience perspective as our friendships are getting weaker, even though  " }, 

{ "sentence": " our followerships and online friendships are getting bigger? So at the neuroscience level,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we have to remember that the brain circuitry, which of course is always linked to the body,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we want to remember brain body are fortunately now understood to be interconnected. Five years ago,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " 10 years ago, that wasn't so much an accepted idea, but the nervous system, the brain, the spinal cord,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and all the connections to the body and back to the brain and spinal cord are bi-directional and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " highly interconnected. So when we say brain, I'm more or less using that as a proxy for whole nervous  " }, 

{ "sentence": " system, including body. The circuits that are responsible for feelings of social connectedness  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are deeply, deeply rooted in our need for safety. We could say this about any organism, but humans  " }, 

{ "sentence": " included need two things. I believe we need the feeling of safety and acceptance. And so we are to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have a conversation about the kind of loftier words like peace, contentment, fulfillment, belonging.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think I borrowed that list, by the way, from the incredible Martha Beck. So it's not a coincidence  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that those rattled off my mind, but I feel like those four words are so critical to what we all want  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and what we all need at an aspirational level. We can't have a discussion about those without also,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I believe, having a discussion about the fact that we have hardwired aspects of our nervous system,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " meaning genetic programs that are written into the script of all our genomes, regardless of color,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " regardless of background that are just scripted into our genome that allow us to breathe without  " }, 

{ "sentence": " thinking about it, digest food without thinking about it, keep our heart rate going without thinking  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about it, elevated if it needs to be, slowed down if it needs to be, et cetera. And then hardwired  " }, 

{ "sentence": " circuitry that is there for bonding with our caretaker during early infancy and bonding with others of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " our species and evaluating whether there is safety and acceptance from the other members of our  " }, 

{ "sentence": " species. Now, these brain circuits have names and we could get into that. They almost all have some  " }, 

{ "sentence": " connectedness to an area of the brain called the hypothalamus, which sits above the roof of your  " }, 

{ "sentence": " mouth, which has many, many dense collections of neurons we call nuclei, responsible for everything  " }, 

{ "sentence": " from temperature regulation to feeding to reproductive behavior and on and on. All the basic kind of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " housekeeping things, but connected to those brain areas are brain areas that are associated with  " }, 

{ "sentence": " evaluating whether one is safe or not. So safety and acceptance, then we can break down in the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " following way if we look at it through this neuroscience lens. Safety is really about the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " ability to predict outcomes. Okay. And the brain, after being responsible for all these housekeeping  " }, 

{ "sentence": " functions, heart rate, et cetera, is largely a predictive organ. It wants to understand what's going to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " happen next to the extent that it can then free up mental real estate, neural real estate to work on  " }, 

{ "sentence": " creative projects or to build things or to imagine things, right? There's no creativity. There's no  " }, 

{ "sentence": " building in the absence of safety. Then it just becomes survival. So the kind of older discussion,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " meaning in the eighties, nineties, and early two thousands, the discussion about the nervous system  " }, 

{ "sentence": " was we would hear about higher brain order functions and limbic functions, right? We would hear about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " kind of primitive lizard brain and more evolved brain. And all of that is frankly true. It remains  " }, 

{ "sentence": " true. And that language is perfectly fine. But I think if we are to think about safety and acceptance,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we say, what is safety about? Safety is about being able to predict outcomes. When we are in the company  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of people, or we know we have people available to us, should we need something? Food. Maybe we need a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " monetary loan. Maybe we need a word of encouragement. Maybe we need somebody to bounce ideas off  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of whatever it is that constitutes safety for us. It's highly subjective, highly individual.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Well, then when those circuits can quiet down, it's as if, you know, they can finally quiet down  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and say, we have enough safety so that then we can start to explore iterating what we have in terms of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " new jobs, new creative ideas, new art, new, you know, take a walk with somebody you care about,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right? Those are not the sorts of things you do when you feel that you are under siege,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " either real siege, physical siege, or emotional siege. Okay. Then acceptance gets a little bit  " }, 

{ "sentence": " trickier to sort of pinpoint in the brain. Acceptance likely dovetails neurologically with  " }, 

{ "sentence": " these brain circuits for safety because acceptance is really about, well, given the range of expressions  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that we have, our range of humor, our range of political beliefs, our range of behaviors,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " can I predict that the safety mechanisms will still be there? These people will still be there.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " These things will still be there. Will they turn on me? Will they honor me, right? Will they laugh  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with my jokes or will they decide they don't want to talk to me anymore because of my jokes? These  " }, 

{ "sentence": " kinds of things. Now, what I'm trying to not do here and at the same time do is to put a neuroscience  " }, 

{ "sentence": " lens onto these two things of safety and acceptance. But if we were to just take a step back and say,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what do we know to absolutely be true? Well, safety and acceptance, belonging, peace, contentment,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " et cetera, come from a variety of sources. Certainly in our early relationship with our  " }, 

{ "sentence": " caretakers, these circuits form that are basically all about resonance with the caretaker. Alan Shore  " }, 

{ "sentence": " here at UCLA has done beautiful work on this. I think the book's title is called Right Brain Psychotherapy.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And it's really about how the bonding of infant and typically mother, or caretaker, the bonding of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " infant, and I'll just say mother because that's the more typical scenario, there's actually a lot  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of synchronization of brain networks early on such that one's physical and mental state reflects the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " other and so on. And so from the very earliest stages that we come into the world, we are resonating  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with other people. Call it energy if you want, call it emotions, it's neurochemical. Yes, it involves  " }, 

{ "sentence": " oxytocin, but a whole lot else. In other words, we leave infancy and childhood and adolescence,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if we have a healthy upbringing, with a sense of predictability. Someone can be there and then not be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there. They're accessible if we need them, et cetera. Now, that sort of relationship, that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " connectivity between humans and safety and acceptance in those relationships has been explored  " }, 

{ "sentence": " extensively. I think we've all seen the image of the mother and child and the brain imaging and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " seeing some sort of collaborative activation of their brain networks. That's been explored  " }, 

{ "sentence": " extensively, and it's beautiful work, and we could always use more of that sort of work.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What's been explored far less is the safety and acceptance that occurs between romantic pairs,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " although there are laboratories starting to do that, having people, for instance, look at the face  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of their significant other, angry, sad, et cetera, while in brain scanners, even scanning of two  " }, 

{ "sentence": " individuals separately at the same time, those sorts of things. Far less has been done on this notion of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " friendship. But I think in this day and age when, well, it seems like everything is more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " complicated, but I'm sure they've been saying that for decades or if not hundreds of thousands of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " years, what do we know about friendship? Friendship is one of the most reliable sources  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of predictability that exists within human interactions. Why? Because you can have many,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " many friends, and you don't have to break up with one friend to have another friend. When we're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " little, they say, who's your best friend? And maybe then you could only have one, but pretty soon  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we realize that we can have many great friends and many best friends. And I consider you one of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " those, like we're growing our friendship, but there's no sense of trade-off, even though of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " course, time is always a trade-off. In fact, you were at a gathering at my home with many other  " }, 

{ "sentence": " friends, right? These things can be collaborative, typically in romantic relationships, while there  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are exceptions to this, is typically a pairing, right? So there are clearly brain networks that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are overlapping with the brain networks associated with parent-child or child caretaker  " }, 

{ "sentence": " relationships and romantic relationships that involve the generation of safety and acceptance  " }, 

{ "sentence": " among friends. The major difference, however, is that friends throughout history, even when people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " lived in small villages, tended to be dispersed by greater distances. And so when we hear about the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " loneliness crisis, are we hearing about a crisis of lack of connectivity with our parents? Maybe.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " With our siblings? Possible. With romantic others? That's a whole domain into itself. You cover a lot  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of that and the challenges associated with finding and building healthy romantic relationship. But what we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " know for sure, based on extensive research now, is that there's a real dearth of close friendships  " }, 

{ "sentence": " relationships for many, many people, not just in the U.S., but abroad as well. Now, we could make an  " }, 

{ "sentence": " argument that it's by virtue of smartphones, but I don't think we want to go there just yet. I think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Jonathan Haidt's doing a beautiful job exploring those ideas, and he's far better equipped to kind  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of pinpoint the relationships, causal or otherwise, than I am. But here's what we know for sure. With  " }, 

{ "sentence": " friends, we can both hope for and expect safety and acceptance by virtue of having lots of different  " }, 

{ "sentence": " kinds of friends. Friends with whom we play sport, friends with whom we just hang out, friends with  " }, 

{ "sentence": " whom we don't really talk too much at all, and friends with whom we drop into deep conversation  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with. So one of the things that I personally have found to be immensely beneficial in my own life,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and for which it's clearly had an outsized positive effect relative to the time required,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is a simple good morning text that comes on a reliable schedule, meaning every single morning.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Now, this might sound almost trivial, but when I wake up in the morning, I either receive or send  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a good morning text to, right now there are about three people in that kind of collection. They're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " not talking to each other. But if I don't receive that text by noon, it activates something in me. It's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " not a ton of anxiety, but it activates something. Are they okay? What's going on with them? You know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it isn't, why aren't they checking up on me? I assume something's come up. But the simple  " }, 

{ "sentence": " receival of a text from somebody saying good morning, I think has both ancient and modern  " }, 

{ "sentence": " significance. Ancient in the sense that one of the first things that everyone experienced when we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " lived in small villages, because that's essentially how we evolved, was to see faces of other, what  " }, 

{ "sentence": " biologists call conspecifics, you know, and other same non-conspecific people, like people that could  " }, 

{ "sentence": " be romantic partners or family members or people we were going to work with. We saw faces first thing in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there's a ton of beautiful work, mainly from Nancy Canwisher's laboratory at MIT, a brilliant  " }, 

{ "sentence": " researcher, as well as a woman named Doris Sow, who now is at Berkeley, was at Caltech, that there's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " an immense amount of neural real estate devoted to the processing of faces, not just facial expressions,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but human faces in particular. Now, monkeys have the same brain area for monkey faces. So this is not  " }, 

{ "sentence": " an area that's just designed to see eyes, nose, and mouth. It's a brain area that has neural real  " }, 

{ "sentence": " estate that responds specifically to the faces of other humans in humans. And there's a whole lot to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " talk about how it's connected with areas of the brain involved in emotion and emotion regulation,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " et cetera. But the simple act of sending a good morning text to one person and receiving that back,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " perhaps exchanging a note or two about what's your plan for the day, doesn't have to be an extensive  " }, 

{ "sentence": " back and forth, but the same person or persons consistently I've experienced in my own life,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in times both good and bad and kind of neutral, that it has this outsized positive effect. And I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " don't think that's because, you know, I was lacking social interaction. My life is very full. I have a very  " }, 

{ "sentence": " busy business life. I can go online and see faces. But when we go online and see a familiar influencer  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or a familiar political figure or a familiar even family member, yes, they're there. And I think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there's great power to that, but they aren't there specifically to see us. Although as creators,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we know that we are there to see our audience and for them to see us. That's a real thing,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but it's quite different to have this exchange, this reciprocity. And I really believe that if  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there was one thing that we could each and all do to better our lives, no matter how busy our social  " }, 

{ "sentence": " schedule or our at-home environments is to have at least one, but probably one to three, depending on  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your bandwidth, one to three friends that every single morning when you wake up, you text them  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and they text you back. Just a simple good morning. Why? Because it's the reliability. It's this notion of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " expectation being fulfilled. It's not a huge expectation. And this brings us back to safety and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " acceptance, right? No one's going to text us good morning if they don't accept us, if they dismiss us.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And the safety is in the predictability of the interaction. Now, for people that walk to the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " corner and they see the barista and they get their coffee or they see their neighbor, et cetera,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the importance of saying hello to people on the street, this is something that's really fallen  " }, 

{ "sentence": " away these days, depends on where you live, but people are very much in their phones. People are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " very much afraid, frankly, of how they will be reacted to if they were to reach out to somebody  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that they don't know. These basic human interactions take us back hundreds, if not thousands,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " maybe even tens or hundreds of thousands of years. And if I were to put my money on any  " }, 

{ "sentence": " experiment, it would be that there is dedicated neural machinery for these sorts of practices.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And while social media has wonderful contributions and significance to make in the well-being of our  " }, 

{ "sentence": " lives, I truly believe that. I am absolutely certain that these simple practices, just as morning  " }, 

{ "sentence": " sunlight can profoundly affect our daytime mood focus and alertness and nighttime sleep, I think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " these simple practices of saying good morning by text each morning to the same person or people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and receiving a text back sets something on the shelf like, okay, we're good to move forward  " }, 

{ "sentence": " through the day.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. Two things came to mind as you were speaking. Your habit of the text every morning makes me feel  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like you're getting to write a story with someone and for someone. And so there's this sense of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " someone knows my story. And now it's not like, oh, I speak to you once a month, and we're catching up  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on everything that happened. And you're missing the nuance and the texture and the detail. It's like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm getting to log my story in every day, which means I really feel this person knows me and I know  " }, 

{ "sentence": " them. So now when we do get together this weekend to break bread, I don't have to do that in between  " }, 

{ "sentence": " small talk. They're already aware. And now we're just almost connecting all the dots as opposed to,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm now using my time with you to plot all the dots. So there's that sense of like story exchange,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " which I think is so important. I find that that my friends who've known me the longest,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but the ones that I also consistently text every day, they're the ones that I feel understand the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " tapestry of my life and I know theirs. And so now you're not just looking at dots on a wall,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're connecting the dots in that meeting, which I think is, I don't know, I'd love to hear  " }, 

{ "sentence": " how that works out from a neuroscience perspective. But the second thing that I was reminded by as you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " were speaking was, I feel like writing down, I always encourage a lot of my clients to do this,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to write down a list of emotions they'd like to experience with people. So it could be things  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like adventure, discovery, comfort, humor, love, whatever it may be, just write down a list.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then for each one, write down the name of a different person, ideally, that fulfills that need  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in your life. Because often I feel like we put a lot of pressure on our romantic partners  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or one person in our life to be all these things. And the truth is, no matter how phenomenal anyone is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or how much they love us, they just can't be that. And so if you have, hey, I've reached out to this  " }, 

{ "sentence": " friend when I want some adventure because they love it too. If I want to see a sports game, this is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the person I reach out to. And then do the same in the opposite way. Which one of those do you fulfill  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for your friends? What emotions do you help other people create? And I feel like if you look at friendship  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as a spectrum, as this broad set of connection points, rather than like, this is my best friend,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as you were saying, or this is my number one friend. And we get away from hierarchy and we move  " }, 

{ "sentence": " more into a spectrum. I feel like that mixed in with the text today starts creating a much more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " healthier network of what connection means as well. It's also not just the same person doing the same  " }, 

{ "sentence": " thing every week.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. I love the idea that by staying in contact regularly, we don't have to get caught up. And  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that then we can just drop into what's most meaningful on that particular day. And maybe even have more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " available to us to have a new experience, right? As opposed to just catching up. And then, of course,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there are those friends that we catch up with and it feels like it was just yesterday.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Definitely.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But I'd be willing to bet that those were people that you spent a lot of day-to-day time activity  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with. You knew them from university or you spent a lot of time just in the kind of everyday shared  " }, 

{ "sentence": " experience for a while. And then when you see each other again, it's like being right back there.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The neuroscience of this hasn't been explored nearly enough. But given that our very own surgeon  " }, 

{ "sentence": " general highlighted the loneliness crisis as one of the major crises in the world today,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think that in terms of simple solutions to big, important problems, developing more connectivity  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with people through simple practices. And again, we're talking about a text here. I mean, I will be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the first to say that if you can hop on a phone call or you can get on a video chat with somebody,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that would certainly be better. But many people just don't have time for that. So in terms of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " spending time with people in a deeper and richer way, you know, getting the drop in time as it were,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I love that you mentioned adventure. I'm almost 49. I turned 49 in just over a month. And I would  " }, 

{ "sentence": " say that the first 49 years of my life have been marked by a real thirst for adventure, a ton of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " curiosity. Now I really feel myself entering a completely different season of my life. I'm sort  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of hoping this would eventually happen in part because, you know, I took some kind of dangerous  " }, 

{ "sentence": " turns. You know, I took risks with my life at points where I didn't really intend to do that. But you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " know, you seek enough adventure, you're going to find adventure and you have to be quite careful.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I have friends with whom I had tons of adventure. And then now the adventures are far more docile and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " quiet. And of course, the internal adventure is real as well. I think that friends with whom  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we can just be one version of ourselves are wonderful. Friends with whom we can be all versions  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of ourself is especially wonderful. That's the acceptance piece. Typically, I think we look more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for that in romantic relationship. This notion of just like safety and acceptance being hallmarks of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " healthy romantic relationship. I think those are also the hallmarks of healthy friendship. It's just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that with friendship, we can be a bit more segmented in terms of the number of different aspects of self  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that we need safety and acceptance with. I think with friendship also, you know, I've found it to be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the case that really knowing what's going on with people has become a little bit more difficult.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " There's this kind of odd thing, right? We're more interconnected in terms of availability of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " communication, but we're less aware of what's really going on for people. In fact, on the way here,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I had a call with a friend and their headset was making a lot of noise. And so we agreed. They said,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " hey, how about I just turn mute mine? And for the next two minutes, I'm not kidding. This is how they,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this is what they said. They said, just tell me like what's on your heart or what's in your heart.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Hopefully it wasn't on your heart. What's in your heart? And I was like, oh, wow, that's tough. You  " }, 

{ "sentence": " know, that's tough. I mean, I, okay. And I know that they're listening and then, but it's very silent  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on the other end. And I'm kind of speaking into a vacuum there because they're not hearing anything.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then had maybe just two minutes before we curled up the hill because of the reception in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the area that we're in, as you know, is always complicated to just get feedback. It was very  " }, 

{ "sentence": " interesting. Like I realized that I felt close to them before, but just the notion that they would  " }, 

{ "sentence": " ask me that, how do I feel? Not what's going on lately, not, you know, am I feeling good or bad,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like evaluation of, of feelings, but just like what's going on. And I stumbled a bit at first,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but I can realize in, in, in saying it now, like I'm quite moved by the fact that they would ask that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of all things, as opposed to like, what's going on? What's your next podcast about? Are you coming  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to visit? That sort of thing. And so like, I'm taking a lot of cues these days from people that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " make me feel very seen and accepted. You're one of them. I must say, like, I don't just say that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because we're in front of these microphones and sitting here, like you and I have been in touch  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a lot lately through good times and hard times and, and, and a lot of different things. It's, it's not  " }, 

{ "sentence": " um, a coincidence though, that, that I think that we're here because I, and talking about this,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because I think that ultimately the questions that we ask of the people we care about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are just as important as reminding them that we're there. Because when we ask a question  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like, you know, what's in your heart, what we're really saying is, you know, like what's really going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on for you as opposed to like, what's the next podcast about, which is an interesting question to me,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but you know, so I, you know, this is more your territory than mine, but I think in the end,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think it comes back to the safety and acceptance, simple behaviors, like a good morning check-in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and then asking questions that might feel a little bit challenging for the other person to answer at  " }, 

{ "sentence": " first, but that really show a depth of care and interest that, um, go beyond just kind of like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " narrative and storytelling. And I think one thing that I'm also very eager about these days is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " breaking down some of the, um, traditional stereotypes, like, you know, for anyone that's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " listening to this and goes, oh, you know, I didn't, you know, men don't talk that way or something.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, actually they do. Um, they do. And if given the chance, they will open up about things  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that perhaps they hadn't even thought about. And I confess I'm one of those people. Maybe it was my  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Y chromosome got in the way of me thinking like, wait, what do you want me to talk about what's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in my heart? Hey, actually, that's a really great question. Thank you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I think this brings us back to these early circuits that are all about safety and acceptance  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that are all about being able to predict things and basically to say, okay, I don't have to be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " vigilant. That's really what safety is about, is about turning off the neural circuits for vigilance.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. When we turn off the neural circuits for vigilance, we can start to direct our neural  " }, 

{ "sentence": " circuits, vision, auditory, whatever thoughts towards an awareness of things that are both inside us and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " around us that keep us in that calm state. I mean, vigilance is associated with stress. Stress is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " associated with a narrowing of the visual field, a narrowing of the auditory fields. I'll just use  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this analogy because my sister and I last, um, last summer, we always go to New York for our birthdays  " }, 

{ "sentence": " together. We went and saw what the Harry Potter play. Oh, it's so good. Right. And I saw it in New  " }, 

{ "sentence": " York too. It's wild. I mean, the effects are so unbelievable. She's a big Harry Potter fan. I'm not,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but I, but okay, but just, just spectacular effects. It was just so wild. I couldn't believe it. But  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there's this library in, in the, in the play where it's, it's a magic library where when one of the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " books is taken out about a particular subject, the books around it actually morph and change  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to reflect the same subject material. And when I saw that, I immediately said, that's how the brain  " }, 

{ "sentence": " works. The way the brain works is a kind of pseudo hypnosis. Hypnosis is about context and context  " }, 

{ "sentence": " setting and narrowing of context. All of us have such a wealth of historical present  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and future thinking cognition in our brains. But when we get anchored to a particular emotional state  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or topic, what ends up happening is that the, the available topics around it change in reference to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " how stressed we are. When we are stressed, all the topics, all the books on the shelf around that stress  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are about that thing and how to solve it. And actually this is why stress enhances our memory  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for solving that, the things that can help us solve that particular issue. But guess what has given up?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " All the other distantly or not so distant really related topics that lend themselves to creativity,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to thinking about novel combinations of things. This is why our friend Rick Rubin, I think is such a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " spectacularly creative individual because he spends a lot of time putting his brain and body into a state  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in which he can remain in contact with these other related or seemingly unrelated topics. Whereas when  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we're in a stressed mode, when we have to problem solve, when we are in visual vigilance, excuse me, we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " absolutely narrow our cognitive fields, our visual fields, our auditory fields. We limit what we think is possible.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I think great friendships to bring it back to it, great relationships of all kinds have enough safety  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and acceptance in them that we can make our way through the practical constraints of the relationship  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in the day, the week and the year, but that there's also a sense of creativity that there are new elements  " }, 

{ "sentence": " allowed to be brought in because there's enough safety and acceptance that we can turn down those vigilance circuits.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Absolutely. How do we then, with circuitry that's built for safety and acceptance,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when you're talking about everything that you talk about on the Huberman Lab, things that I talk about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " from a maybe more spiritual wisdom perspective, they're all hard things. And safety and acceptance,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " generally, in our current understanding of those words, feels like comfort and security and easy and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " simple. And then all of a sudden, you're saying cold plunges, infrared sauna, beginning of circadian  " }, 

{ "sentence": " rhythm in the morning, strength workouts, like all this other stuff, which initially is discomfort,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's difficult, it's doing hard things. And I know this was something you've been thinking about a lot,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but I'm just trying to make that connection. We're wired for safety and acceptance, but then all the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " stuff that's good for us seems to be hard, at least in the beginning.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah, that's a great question. So the twist in all of this is that the nervous system loves  " }, 

{ "sentence": " predictability, even if the predictability is arriving through hard things. So I would say the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " major theme of the Huberman Lab podcast has been tools, we call them protocols, to anchor one's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " physiology in some predictable states. I've never actually articulated that, but that's really what  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's about. So why get sunlight in your eyes in the morning? Because it wakes you up. I could tell you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it increases cortisol in a good way early in the day, that it sets a timer on your melatonin secretion  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for later at night, it helps you sleep at night. And that's all true, but it creates a sense of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " predictability. It allows you to know that for the next series of hours, you're going to feel more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " alert and at night, you're likely going to be able to fall asleep more easily. Cold plunges, to my mind,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people debate whether or not they're valuable for combating inflammation. They are. Whether  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or not they're valuable for increasing metabolism, probably not to a huge extent.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But one thing we know for sure is that they, if done correctly, they're uncomfortable. But after you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " get out, you have an increase in these three neurochemicals that we call the catecholamines,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and you feel more energized and slightly blissed out  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for the next two to four hours. It's a real effect because those are real chemicals  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and they've served that role for hundreds of thousands of years in humans, and they will  " }, 

{ "sentence": " continue to serve that role in humans. So the cold plunge is not so much about pushing yourself  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as it is figuring out a way that you can overcome a sense of stress and then safely, or overcome a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " sense of kind of resistance to getting in the thing, and then safely increase these neurochemicals that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " then predictably shift your state to be more alert and at the same time relaxed and a little bit  " }, 

{ "sentence": " blissed out if we want to call it that. So, you know, we could list off protocol after protocol,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right? If you tend to eat meals at a consistent time, plus or minus an hour, doesn't matter if you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " fast or not, you'll tend to be hungry about 15 minutes or so before those meals. This is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a wonderful thing because it increases this predictability. This lends itself to safety  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and acceptance because it allows you to have to not have to think about a number of other things.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So, you know, I've been criticized and fairly so that, gosh, there's so many protocols. How could  " }, 

{ "sentence": " anyone possibly do all these protocols? And the truth is that many of the protocols are,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know, it's a buffet. And many of them, like how to organize your workspace or when you travel  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for jet lag, it's individual as to whether or not people want to do them. And of course,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they're all optional. You know, this isn't law. So the idea, however, is that through some simple  " }, 

{ "sentence": " basic behaviors, viewing sunlight, a little bit of a walk after a meal, a little bit of sunlight in the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " evening, dimming the lights in the evening. You know, these are the basics. Eating at more or less  " }, 

{ "sentence": " consistent mealtimes and mostly unprocessed or minimally processed foods for the majority of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your food intake. Doesn't matter if you're vegan, vegetarian, or otherwise, you're going to feel  " }, 

{ "sentence": " much, much better. And part of the much, much better is feeling more alert and more vitality  " }, 

{ "sentence": " during the waking hours and better sleep at night, which just kind of seesaw back and forth into  " }, 

{ "sentence": " feeling better overall and thereby free up energy for things like sending the morning text. You know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so I think I'm very glad you brought this up because I think people hear, oh goodness, another  " }, 

{ "sentence": " thing to do. But if you think about it that way, it's going to be self-limiting. But if you think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about it as each one of these things takes a minimum amount of time and you can do the walk  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and sunlight thing in the morning combined, and maybe if you miss a day, no big deal. No big deal.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " These are slow integrative systems. Your system will recover just fine. But done on a consistent basis,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're going to feel much better and you're going to have more energy. And you're going to be able to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " think about what you might want to do in your creative life and then do that. You'll have the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " time and energy to think about what you might want to do relationship wise or friendship wise or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " building out these aspects of life. So it was never the intention that people do so many things  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that they don't have time for friendship or kids or relationship or that their entire family or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " relationship be centered around these protocols. Rather, they're designed to be weaved into  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everyday life. And sometimes when people experience pain points, like people are having  " }, 

{ "sentence": " attentional issues or people are experiencing depression or they have a particular creative  " }, 

{ "sentence": " project and they want to tap into like open monitoring meditation, for instance, very different  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as you know far better than I, than other forms of meditation, then they can access those specific  " }, 

{ "sentence": " tools. But I don't want to romanticize ancient times, but there was a lot more predictability  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in some domains of life in ancient times. Assuming people were living in small villages,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there was a lot more predictability, but there was also a lack of predictability. Someone could take off on a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " hunt or a gather and they, if they didn't come back, we might assume they're never coming back. And then  " }, 

{ "sentence": " two nights later, they might come back and say that was a close call or they come back with a great yield.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " We don't know, you know, we don't know what it was like, but you can be sure that the same neural  " }, 

{ "sentence": " circuits that were responsible for stress and lack of safety and therefore vigilance back then are very  " }, 

{ "sentence": " much alive in our brains now. So again, the protocols are designed to think about it like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " putting ingredients in the refrigerator. You don't know what you're going to cook, but you have a lot  " }, 

{ "sentence": " more available to you as options when you have, when you know that all the basic macronutrients are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " covered. Everything's, all the bases are covered. And then you can start to think about what you would  " }, 

{ "sentence": " cook. Whereas if you've ever arrived late in the city, you get to your Airbnb or your hotel and you see  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like three or four things and one lousy pan and thing with that. Now you have to get the other kind  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of creative where you have to adapt. And we've all done the, the unhealthy option because that was the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " only thing or fasted because that was the healthiest option. So I think what we're, what we're getting  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to here is that the human brain, like all animals, all animals need to know where they're going to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " sleep that night. I mean, a dog goes into a new environment and is like trying to figure out where's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " its spot. It's all about space. You talk to any expert dog trainer, they'll tell you, you know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's all about negotiating space. Can they touch you? Can they not touch you? Are they allowed to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " be near you? Do they have to stay afar? Can they go into every room? You know, you look at small  " }, 

{ "sentence": " children foraging an environment, however rambunctious or calm, they're, they're trying  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to figure out like, what am I allowed to do here? What am I not allowed to do here? Sometimes by  " }, 

{ "sentence": " testing us as, as adults, we do the exact same thing. We need to know where we are. We need to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " orient in space and in time. And then we need to know like, what, what's available to me? Where am  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I going to stay tonight? Is one of the most fundamental questions that we ask ourselves  " }, 

{ "sentence": " every single day, except if you know where you're going to stay tonight, you don't ask yourself that,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and you have mental real estate to devote to other things. So what we're really talking about here is,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is kind of bookending the extremely basic fundamental drives of the human brain for safety and acceptance.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then at the very other end is these aspirational things that we all seek, right? These,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " these notions of connectedness, of, of purpose, of, of fulfillment, of, of peace. Again,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm borrowing from Martha's beautiful list because I think it's so fundamental and, and it captures  " }, 

{ "sentence": " most, if not all of what we all seek. But I think that, you know, we get very much caught up in the,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " how to reach goal A or B, how to write the book, how to make the money, how to grow a social media  " }, 

{ "sentence": " account. And we forget that at the core of everything is our relationship to our surroundings,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to our inner landscape, and to each other. And it always comes back to safety and acceptance.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And where we feel uncomfortable, where we feel like we didn't do things right or others didn't do them  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right for us or to us. It always boils down to those two things.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Hmm. Yeah. You've reminded me of a question I often ask people is what's your most repeated thought?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Because when I was looking at the research on thinking, the idea was that not only  " }, 

{ "sentence": " were we having a lot of thoughts every day, but a lot of the thoughts we have are repetitive.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And going back to your point on protocols, I feel like the reason we have repeated thoughts is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because we haven't yet built a protocol to help that thought go away. So if you built a protocol,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like I know where I'm sleeping tonight, you're now no longer having that thought of where am I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " sleeping tonight? And we may be asking ourselves a very different thing today because we figured out  " }, 

{ "sentence": " where to sleep, but we might be thinking like, how am I going to pay that bill? How am I going to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " deal with that issue at home? What should I say to my kid? You know, whatever it is, right?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " We all have different challenges. Everyone has a different set of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " issues that they're struggling with or dealing with. And because we haven't created a protocol,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we keep asking that question. And that question then creates panic and creates anxiety and creates  " }, 

{ "sentence": " stress and eventually could lead to burnout if someone just keeps propelling that thought  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and doesn't create a protocol. So I love the idea that people should build the protocol that links  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with their most repeated thought rather than having to think, oh God, I've got to do 25 things.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like, well, no, what is the thing that is keeping you up at night? Or what is the thing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's causing you the greatest anxiety? And try and solve for that. It's like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you're out of milk, you go and buy milk. You don't say, I've got to buy 25 other things.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " You just go fill the part of the refrigerator that's empty. Does that align?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah, absolutely. I love what we're bridging over and over here is the very practical,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " foundational elements of safety with these aspirational things. You know, I'm a big  " }, 

{ "sentence": " believer in physiology driving mental states. They go the other way too. Emotional states drive  " }, 

{ "sentence": " physiology. It's bi-directional, of course. One of the reasons why I've been so emphatic about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " respiration protocols is, A, my lab published a clinical trial on this in collaboration with David  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Spiegel in our department of psychiatry, which basically could be summarized the following way.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " If you emphasize exhales, you tend to calm down, meaning you make them longer, more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and intentional. Normally we inhale actively and we passively exhale. Other species do it the other  " }, 

{ "sentence": " way around, some other species. If you deliberately emphasize your exhales, the duration,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the intensity, or just even control the exhale actively, your heart rate slows.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " When we emphasize inhales, we don't necessarily have to do hyperventilation or tummo breathing or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " anything like that. We could, but those forms of breathing tend to bring up our activation state  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and they emphasize inhales, both by virtue of vigor, duration, or just putting more conscious  " }, 

{ "sentence": " attention to them. And there's a reason for this. It's called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. It's an  " }, 

{ "sentence": " actual phenomenon that links the heart and the vagus nerve and our diaphragm and our lungs. It's a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " beautiful mechanism. When I'm overthinking at night and I want to fall asleep, I start doing long  " }, 

{ "sentence": " exhale breathing through my mouth. Now, sometimes I'm out. I just fall asleep. I know that because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I wake up sometime later, realize it worked again. Other times it doesn't work so well, right? And one of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the most common questions I get is how to turn off repetitive thoughts. Now there it's a bit of a skill  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because, you know, frankly, repetitive thoughts oftentimes are serving an adaptive purpose,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but we can get stuck on them, right? Or they can get stuck in us. I don't know which one it is. But  " }, 

{ "sentence": " one of the reasons why I'm such a strong believer in people doing a practice like yoga nidra,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " which, you know, and I must say, I know I've upset to some extent some people by coining something  " }, 

{ "sentence": " very similar, non-sleep deep rest or NSDR. I want to make very clear that I have the utmost respect  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for yoga nidra as an ancient practice. Neither yoga nidra, of course, nor NSDR were anything I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " developed. It's just that NSDR, it's a little bit different in that it removes intentions and it tends  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to involve a little bit less of some of the linking of chakras and things like that, that yoga nidra does  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with no specific purpose in mind behind designing that way, except to be able to adapt it to the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " laboratory context. Okay. What do we know about, let's just call it its original name, yoga nidra.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " The goal is to stay awake, to be conscious while deliberately relaxing the body. That's a very useful  " }, 

{ "sentence": " practice. Feels similar to meditation in a way, could be called a meditation, but it has some distinct  " }, 

{ "sentence": " benefits. First of all, a beautiful study that was done in Denmark at a medical school in Copenhagen  " }, 

{ "sentence": " showed that people that do a yoga nidra practice get a 60% increase in baseline dopamine levels in the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " basal ganglia, brain area that's associated with the preparation for movement and the withholding of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " movement. So it essentially can be looked at as a practice that changes neurochemicals in the brain  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that restore mental and physical vigor. That's how I think of yoga nidra. It's sort of like sleep.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " There are some studies emerging, including some that I'm planning with Dr. Matt Walker at Berkeley,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " one of the preeminent sleep researchers in the world that are going to explore whether or not little  " }, 

{ "sentence": " pockets of the brain are actually sleeping or in rapid eye movement sleep-like states during yoga  " }, 

{ "sentence": " nidra. If you think about rapid eye movement sleep, just as a very relevant aside,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's a state in which the brain is very active and the body is completely still,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " much like yoga nidra. Okay. Brain active, body still. Now what's unique about yoga nidra  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is that there's this instruction in the nidra, if it's a traditional one, that talks about going from  " }, 

{ "sentence": " thinking and doing to being and feeling. Okay. So let's step back as neuroscientists and we say  " }, 

{ "sentence": " thinking is a lot about anticipating future. It could be about thinking about the past. It could be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " thinking about things that are happening now, but it's a very forebrain dependent process.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Doing is basal ganglia, action generation, withholding action, and forebrain circuitry as  " }, 

{ "sentence": " well. I should say prefrontal cortical circuitry as well. Now being and feeling, now this is starting  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to sound a little bit like, quote unquote, softer language, but there's nothing soft about this  " }, 

{ "sentence": " language because if we just put a neuroscience lens on it, we say, okay, what is that really about?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That's about bringing ourselves from exteroception monitoring of the external world beyond the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " confines of our skin to monitoring of the internal world within the confines of our skin. And there's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " something magical about shifting our perception to interoception from our skin inward in that it takes  " }, 

{ "sentence": " us out of thinking. Whereas when we're monitoring the external world for reasons that are sort of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " logical, but a little bit harder to articulate, then it's more about anticipating things, trying to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " figure out what goes with what, what's separate from what. The moment we get to the level of our  " }, 

{ "sentence": " skin and inward, we know what's what and what's separate from what. It's just us inward. It's sort  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of, there's one thing. Rarely do we think, oh, here's my brain and here's my leg. Now Nidra then steps  " }, 

{ "sentence": " us through that. And so what it does is it brings all of our cognition into this interoceptive mode.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then boom, we are in this mode of being and feeling. So I don't think of being and feeling as  " }, 

{ "sentence": " turning off thinking. I think of it as bringing thinking to the level of our sensation of our body.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yoga Nidra I think is perhaps the most powerful practice for learning how to turn off one's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " thoughts. And so when one steps back from the research literature and says, okay, what do we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " know for sure about Yoga Nidra and SDR? We know that this can be done for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30  " }, 

{ "sentence": " minutes or an hour. We know that it can very reliably improve levels of wakefulness, cognition,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and vigor post Nidra. We know that it restores dopamine levels to a marked extent in the basal  " }, 

{ "sentence": " ganglia. We know that the brain goes into little pockets of sleep-like states. This needs to be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " explored further. And we know that it mimics rapid eye movement sleep. And we know that people who do it  " }, 

{ "sentence": " find it easier to make themselves fall back asleep should they need to, and they develop much stronger  " }, 

{ "sentence": " powers of autonomic regulation, their ability to take themselves out of stress if they need to.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I mean, if ever there was a powerful practice, Yoga Nidra is that practice. And so when I step back  " }, 

{ "sentence": " from the landscape of practices that can help us turn off thinking or et cetera, this is probably a good  " }, 

{ "sentence": " time to just, you know, mention that, you know, meditation I view as an exploration of one's own  " }, 

{ "sentence": " consciousness. I also view it as a perceptual exercise, shifting one's perception to a particular  " }, 

{ "sentence": " location as opposed to just wherever the mind may take it, put simply. I mean, it's far more profound  " }, 

{ "sentence": " than that, as you know, and as many know. But meditation has been shown to, right, reduce stress,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " improve focus, improve memory. I'm thinking mainly of the studies by Wendy Suzuki's lab at NYU. I'm  " }, 

{ "sentence": " thinking of the studies that were done out of the University of Wisconsin that are talked about in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Altered States, which is a wonderful book and the work that you've talked about in your books.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " When I think about Yoga Nidra, non-sleep deep rest, it's really about restoring mental and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " physical vigor and getting better at regulating one's own autonomic internal kind of hinge going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " back and forth between sympathetic and parasympathetic that, you know, kind of fight or flight and rest  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and digest, alert and calm, learning how to adjust that in a conscious way. And then when I think of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " practices like breath work, well, it depends on the breath work. And then we can simplify it by saying  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when inhales are more vigorous and made longer deliberately than exhales, heart rate goes up,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " alertness goes up. When exhales are made longer and more vigorous and done deliberately, well,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " then heart rate tends to go down and we tend to shift more towards the state of calm. And then,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of course, there's hypnosis. And hypnosis to me is self-hypnosis, which is a clinical tool that David  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Spiegel and others around the world, but mainly David Spiegel and his father popularized within the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " formal field of psychiatry. And hypnosis is a combination of alertness and calm that we know  " }, 

{ "sentence": " lends itself to neuroplasticity. What is hypnosis really for? It's not meditation. It's not to calm  " }, 

{ "sentence": " down. It's to solve a specific problem, to quit smoking, to learn how to regulate pain, to, you know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " any number of different things that hypnosis has been shown in peer-reviewed studies to do.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So when I step back, I say, okay, meditation, non-sleep deep rest, aka yoga nidra, I should say  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yoga nidra, aka non-sleep deep rest, breathwork, and hypnosis. Well, now we have a kit of tools that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are available to us to kind of adjust our internal state. And any one of those could be used to turn  " }, 

{ "sentence": " off thinking. But the most powerful one, in my opinion, and by way of experience and sort of how  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm viewing the research literature, I'm sure there are others out there that would disagree with me,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and that's fine, is yoga nidra. If ever there was a practice that I wish every human being on  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the planet would do besides go out and view morning sunlight, it would be yoga nidra.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And of course, this has been available for thousands of years. And unfortunately,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it has not gotten the traction worldwide that I think it deserves. And especially at this time  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in human history when the world seems so tense with friction of all sorts of kinds, but also internal  " }, 

{ "sentence": " friction for people. I think it's just, you know, it's something that I really, really want to shine  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a light on as a tremendously beneficial tool for turning off thoughts when it's necessary and for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " accessing, you know, some people call these atypical states, but most people go from sleep  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to waking and sleep to waking without really an exploration of what those different states are like.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So in any event, forgive me for being long-winded.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " No, not at all.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But those are the tools that when I step back and I say, where is there great neuroscience and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " physiology to support their use? What are the specific uses that seem especially valuable for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " one practice versus another? And how do these practices differ? Because they often get conflated.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Somebody starts breath work and we think, oh, it's this type of breath work or that type of,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " without thinking about what's being emphasized and where the heart rate is going. And,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or we think meditation. And of course, there are many different kinds of meditation. Actually,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'd love to know from you. I know of kind of traditional third eye meditation,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and I'm aware of open monitoring meditation. What other sorts of meditation do you do?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " As you mentioned, there's breath work, there's visualization and there's mantra or sound.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So the meditation on the repetition of sound, whether that be natural sounds, whether it be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " instruments or whether it be the repetition of mantra in your own voice or the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " collective chanting, which it's done through ancient times of the collective chance of sacred sounds.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's considered one of the forms of meditation. And it almost feels like a humming kind of cocoon effect  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of being kind of surrounded by this sound that's repeated again and again and again. So it can kind  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of get you into that kind of submerged, immersive, drowning feeling that I think most people, if  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they've done a sound bowl meditation, have experienced some form of what that could feel like. And again,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you're getting into that atypical state. But going back to what you were saying, what really  " }, 

{ "sentence": " resonated for me and what I've always appreciated about your work, Andrew, I said this last time  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you came on the show, is this connection between these ancient practices and the modern neuroscience  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to back it up. Like when you've talked about many, many times about sunlight in the morning,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I mean, Surya Namaskar, which I mentioned last time is sun salutations. That is the practice that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you would do when you wake up in the morning and you salute the sun. And it was this idea of allowing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the sunlight to enter in through your eyes. And now you're talking about yoga nidra at the end of the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " day to go to sleep. Again, to me, you've found this way of not only broadcasting and helping people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " come to these practices, but helping them be translated into modern day language, which I think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is so needed with a scientific backing. And going back to yoga nidra, I can personally say just from a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " personal practice point of view, I had a surgery two years ago and I was in so much physical pain  " }, 

{ "sentence": " during that first month of recovery. The only way I could go to sleep was through yoga nidra  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because the thoughts of pain and of stress and of potential redamage or whatever it may have been  " }, 

{ "sentence": " was so high that that state could only be lowered through yoga nidra. And when I'm jet lagged and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm traveling across the world, yoga nidra is my go to to be able to switch off in a new country  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when I'm like, gosh, I'm going to be up all night. Will I make it to my work thing tomorrow?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yoga nidra completely allows me to remove those thoughts and allow myself to fall asleep.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So I use it all the time and I couldn't encourage it. I'm so glad that you're broadcasting and helping  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people understand the science behind it because yeah, these ancient practices make sense, but they  " }, 

{ "sentence": " need a new language and a new translation today. Yeah. Yoga nidra has such similarity to rapid  " }, 

{ "sentence": " eye movement sleep. As far as we know, it's not the exact same brain state, but the similarity again is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " mind alert, body still, which is exactly what happens during rapid eye movement sleep. And we know rapid  " }, 

{ "sentence": " eye movement sleep is essential for formation of memories, for uncoupling of negative emotions from  " }, 

{ "sentence": " previous day experiences. It tends to be more enriched in the later parts of the night and so on.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " For me, yoga nidra is the practice to do when I wake up in the morning, but I don't feel completely  " }, 

{ "sentence": " rested. I'll do anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes of that. And then in the afternoon, instead  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of a nap, I'll do nidra. And sometimes I'll fall asleep admittedly. And then if I wake up in the middle  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of the night, nidra is my solution. I think that mind active body still is such an interesting and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " frankly, unusual state, unless we're in rapid eye movement sleep, that most people until they try it  " }, 

{ "sentence": " can't really appreciate the immense value that it brings. But the beautiful thing is it works the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " first time and it works every time. Our mutual friend, Rick Rubin, we're both lucky enough to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " know him and to spend a little bit of time with him. And Rick has a practice that he does. I know  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because I went and visited him last summer and he would just sit there with his eyes closed and his  " }, 

{ "sentence": " body very still. And at some point I asked him, what are you doing? And he said, well, I'm thinking.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I said, what's the benefit of doing this? You know? And he said, well, I come up with ideas  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this way. And I thought, oh, that's interesting. And it immediately rung a bell. I had a guest on  " }, 

{ "sentence": " my podcast. It was actually the first guest ever on my podcast, professor by the name of Dr. Carl  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Diceroth. He's an MD and a PhD. He's the world's arguably top bioengineer in the field of neuroscience.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " He's also a psychiatrist. So he sees patients and he also has raised five children. He's one of these  " }, 

{ "sentence": " phenoms. His wife's a neurologist at Stanford that, you know, is a remarkable person, very deep thinker.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I was talking to him on the podcast and he said that he has a practice whereby  " }, 

{ "sentence": " at night, after his kids go to sleep, he sits at the table or on the couch, stills his body completely  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and forces himself to think in complete sentences for about an hour. And I thought to myself, whoa,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's a wildly unusual practice. And I said, what, what is it about? And he said, well, that's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " how I structure my ideas. That's where new ideas come to me. So Carl's doing that, Rick's doing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that. You start looking back through history, you find out that Einstein had a walking practice  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that then he would, my father's a theoretical physicist. So this is where I learned this,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but presumably this is verifiable. I'm sure someone will tell me it's not true, but enough people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have told me it is that I'm inclined to at least describe it where he would walk, then stop and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " allow his thoughts to continue as if in motion, mind active, body still, and then repeat.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So this is a very unusual state of mind that I think has real value. And we know in sleep, rapid eye  " }, 

{ "sentence": " movement, sleep, and the associated dreams are where we work out a lot of novel solutions to hard daytime  " }, 

{ "sentence": " problems. And I can confidently say that the field of neuroscience can say so much more about the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " different states of the mind in sleep than we can about the states of the mind in waking.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's kind of amazing. It's 2024. We know all this information about different brain areas,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what happens when you stimulate this, these neurochemicals and that. And yet we have words,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " stage one, two, three, four, rapid eye movement, sleep, slow wave sleep. We have real mechanistic  " }, 

{ "sentence": " understanding of the states of the mind and body in sleep and very, very little language to describe  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like the state of mind that we happen to be in right now. So we can talk about hypnosis, which  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is a narrowed context, calm, but alert in which neuroplasticity, brain changes are more available to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " us. This is supported by clinical and research data. We can talk about being attentive. We can talk about  " }, 

{ "sentence": " being stressed, but, but if you think about like, it's like very crude understanding. And so when I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " think about practices like body still mind active, or even, you know, something that I found immensely  " }, 

{ "sentence": " beneficial every Sunday, I try and take a long hike or walk and I try and just let my mind spool out  " }, 

{ "sentence": " whatever ideas it happens to have. You know, I like to think it's accessing some subconscious that's been,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know, kind of packed with ideas and experiences during the week. But what do we call that?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I call it a walk or a run or a hike, but I think that the, the different states of mind that we can  " }, 

{ "sentence": " go into during the day need more attention, not just from neuroscience researchers, but from people in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the fields of meditation, people in the fields of health and wellness, you know, what are the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " different states of mind? And so I would say that the last, you know, really 40, but you know, 30  " }, 

{ "sentence": " mainly, but five or six years of my life, I've been a public educator in the realm of trying to teach  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people ways to harness their physiology in ways that serve them best for mental health and physical  " }, 

{ "sentence": " health and performance. But I'm now starting to get very, very curious about how to evolve this thing  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that we call brain states and our understanding of not just through language, but really understanding  " }, 

{ "sentence": " how to bring our mind into sharp focus, how to be in the best state of mind for connectedness,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " when to turn off empathy, when to turn on empathy. I mean, these are all circuitries within us that are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " possible. And of course we have variation among us as a species as to whether or not we lean more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " towards logical thinking or empathic, you know, affiliative thinking, these kinds of things. But,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know, I really believe that, you know, people like you, Jay, have an important role to play.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And that the conversation between neuroscientists, people who have knowledge of meditative practices  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like yourself, there's real value in the overlap. And you said, you know, that you were grateful that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we're talking about these things, ancient practices and what they might mean. If I've learned anything,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and I think I'm finally old enough that I can make that statement, if I've learned anything in my life,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right? Hopefully my life will continue. But if it, you know, should I go someplace else before I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " anticipate? I think it's become very clear to me that whether or not you're talking about yoga  " }, 

{ "sentence": " tradition or you're talking about neuroscience, or you're talking about traditional medicine or some  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of the more alternative medicines, the overlap in those Venn diagrams is where the real money is.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I don't necessarily mean financial gain. I mean, that's where the great ideas are.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I totally agree. So I'm perfectly happy to talk about yoga nidra, NSDR, brain circuits associated,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " dopamine, basal ganglia, because ultimately, if I'm here to do anything, it's to try and bridge these  " }, 

{ "sentence": " silos and bring people's awareness to the fact that we've all been talking about the same thing.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And we're all seeking the same things, safety, acceptance, creativity, you know, these  " }, 

{ "sentence": " connectedness, purpose, fulfillment, these loftier ideals start with having our physiology  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in a place where we can reliably move forward, not have to worry about certain things. And then a little  " }, 

{ "sentence": " space opens up and so on and so forth. But I think there's a real calling now for anyone that's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " interested in the brain, anyone that's interested in health, and anyone that's interested in humanity,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to really start paying attention to the overlap in the Venn diagrams between REM sleep and waking  " }, 

{ "sentence": " states between ancient practices and modern practices. And I should warn that that person  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or those people, you're going to take some heat, you know, but ultimately, the ability to go between  " }, 

{ "sentence": " these silos and to bridge them, as we're trying to do now, and hopefully are making some ground in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this, I believe we are, is going to serve humanity very, very well. Because it's just been too long  " }, 

{ "sentence": " whereby people are holding back knowledge, the secret of some chemical, the secret of some practice.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " There's no secret. The secret is they all work to some extent. The question is, what are the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " commonalities? What are the mechanisms? And what are the practices that allow people to bring their brain  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and body into the state that best serves them and other people? Yeah. And it's accessible,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but we have to have a slightly open mind about the language. We have to give up the ego saying,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " oh, that's my practice, that that breathwork is the domain of my school or my thing. And frankly,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " those arguments aren't working anymore anyway, because information is so freely available on the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " internet. So in any case, there's a little bit of editorializing there, I realize, but it's also  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a calling to anyone that's interested in the mind and in the brain that, you know, neuroscience  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is no longer the unique domain of neuroscientists. And I know that some of my neuroscience colleagues  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are going to be like, oh boy, you know, here he is just as if it's accessible to anybody. I'm not  " }, 

{ "sentence": " saying you can be a neurosurgeon if you aren't trained in neurosurgery, right? But I'm not saying  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that you can be an advanced meditative practitioner without putting in the hours. What I am saying is that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there's overlap in the Venn diagrams of these different fields. And the more collegiality,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the faster and further we're going to go as a species.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Well, I think it goes back to what you were just saying a few moments ago that we only have a language  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for, and I'm going to put an umbrella term here, but we only have language for the extremes of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " experience. So what you were saying is when you're on a hike or a walk, you don't have a term for what  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that feels like, because it's not an extreme of being asleep or being awake. It's kind of like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this in between cerebral state that we don't have a language for. And I think that on a micro level  " }, 

{ "sentence": " makes sense to all of us where we have words like I'm angry or I'm sad or I'm upset, but our word for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is okay, right? Like a word for okay is okay, which isn't a great descriptor of how we actually feel.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so we're only good at describing things in extremes on a micro level. And then if you zoom  " }, 

{ "sentence": " out and take that on a macro level, that translates as well, where we're only good at dealing with these  " }, 

{ "sentence": " extremes. And when you're saying Venn diagram, it's saying, well, get away from the extremes  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and look at the overlaps. But I think we as a society on a micro level and at a macro level  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have only learned how to deal with the pendulum swing on either side or the extremes on either  " }, 

{ "sentence": " side. And therefore anything in the middle or the gray starts to feel uncomfortable, starts to feel  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's not easy to say whether it's right or wrong. And therefore it's like, well, we're not even going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to go there. And I think anyone that I've spoken to at the top of their field, you being one of them,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " anyone we've ever had on the show is far more interested in the gray, is far more in the gray,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and is spending far more time exploring thought that is unclear, uncomfortable, and uncertain,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because that's where life really is lived in the unpredictable.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah, that's the adventure.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That is the adventure. That is the adventure. And I feel that that's why humans want to go to space.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like, why is everyone fascinated by space? Because it's not clear as to what it is and what's out  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there and where it is. And of course, not many people will get to go to space, at least for now.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But the idea being the same that there has to be that curiosity from all of us to say,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " oh, where are we in the same place? Like, where are we connected on our idea? And where are there  " }, 

{ "sentence": " things that aren't similar, but maybe they're connected in a different way? And I think being  " }, 

{ "sentence": " able to oscillate between connectivity and disconnectedness is a need for the brain and the mind,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as opposed to this feeling of, again, it goes back to what we started with. Safety and acceptance  " }, 

{ "sentence": " makes us feel today that you can't allow yourself to engage in an idea that doesn't fully connect with  " }, 

{ "sentence": " yours, because that feels unsafe. Right. Especially right now, right? Things feel very polarized.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Correct. You know, I'm putting in a very strong vote for the League of Reasonable People,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " which is hopefully everybody. Right? Like, I don't want to sound overly sentimental, but like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I, and maybe I'm just too emotional lately, but I am so pained by the amount of fighting that I see,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that I know will not result in any, anything. It's not going to solve the problem for either side. Right?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I guess at 49, I feel old enough to say this. Like I, I have, I still have hope,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but that's obviously not a solution. I think that when we really get down to the neuroscience  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of self-understanding, when people really start to understand that the human brain is a magnificent  " }, 

{ "sentence": " machine and organ, but that it has limitations and we can start to understand our own limitations,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know, that it can take us just up to this point, but not further. And that we can rely on  " }, 

{ "sentence": " healthy collective thinking, healthy collective thinking to get us over these divides. I think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's when we're finally going to evolve as a species. I really do. When we, when we start being  " }, 

{ "sentence": " able to exit our, our, our own brain and our group think to be able to really come to solutions, because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " often we just think in terms of compromise and conflict, which are essential things to think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about, but ultimately understanding the limits of our cognition and how emotion drives cognition  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is really how we're going to be able to evolve our beliefs about what's possible. And by the way,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's not meant to just be a bunch of aspirational word salad. That's like a real possibility. If we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " can just have the self-reflection to understand, we know certain things, we believe certain things,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but that this neural architecture that we call our brain is limited in the extent to which it can see  " }, 

{ "sentence": " into the future and make the best decisions for everybody. We operate thinking that, but that's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " not how it works. And of course we can't look to any one individual to solve the problem for everybody.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Now, will it be AI? I don't know. That involves a lot of trust in AI and these large language models are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " trained in many ways, the same way that a neural network, it trains itself up how a young brain  " }, 

{ "sentence": " develops and makes sense of the world. So I don't have any immediate solutions.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " What I do have is a piece of neuroscience knowledge that was at least new to me that most  " }, 

{ "sentence": " neuroscientists aren't aware of, but I think this is one of the most important discoveries in the last  " }, 

{ "sentence": " hundred years of neuroscience. It's a collection of studies on an area of the brain called the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " anterior mid-cingulate cortex. Most people have never heard of this brain area, including  " }, 

{ "sentence": " many neuroscientists. Doctor or neurosurgeon, they know where it is. You talk to a neuroscientist,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " unless they teach neuroanatomy, which I happen to, most don't know where it is in the brain and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " most didn't know what it did because it hadn't been explored. And then a colleague of mine at  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Stanford School of Medicine named Joe Parvizzi did an incredible study where he was doing neurosurgery  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and stimulating different brain areas as a means to try and find the location where he needed to do the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " surgery. And he stumbled upon an area called the anterior mid-cingulate cortex, where if he  " }, 

{ "sentence": " stimulated with an electrode, people, because they were awake during the neurosurgery, would report  " }, 

{ "sentence": " feeling as if there was some conflict pressing on them. One even described it as, I feel like I'm  " }, 

{ "sentence": " driving into a storm, but I feel ready. I can do this. Others reported a different set of words,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but the words essentially converged around the same set of subjective experiences, which are,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I feel challenged, but I can do it. It's kind of forward center of mass. And then other studies,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " separate laboratories discovered that people that take on a new practice that's challenging for them,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " their anterior mid-cingulate cortex grows in volume. Other people who fail to successfully  " }, 

{ "sentence": " engage in a regular challenging activity, the anterior mid-cingulate cortex didn't increase  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in volume in the same way. So very interesting brain structure. And there's, I would say, about a dozen  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or so really quality studies in humans, a bunch in animal models, but there are a bunch in humans  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that point to the anterior mid-cingulate cortex as a site in the brain associated with the feeling of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " tenacity and willpower to push through. It's heavily interconnected with the dopamine reward  " }, 

{ "sentence": " system, heavily connected, frankly, with a lot of different brain areas. It's a hub for a lot of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " inputs and outputs. So what do we know about the anterior mid-cingulate cortex? Perhaps most interesting  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of all is that this is the brain area that seems to preserve its size and even grow in size in what  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are called super-agers. Super-agers are people that maintain their cognition later into life. These are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people that don't undergo the normal age-related decline in cognition, separate from Alzheimer's type  " }, 

{ "sentence": " dementia. You know, everybody as they get older develops less working memory, the ability to keep  " }, 

{ "sentence": " ideas in mind in the short term. Super-agers seem to overcome all that. And they live longer. So you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " could say, well, this is a case of reverse causality. They live longer, so they have a bigger brain area  " }, 

{ "sentence": " called the anterior mid-cingulate cortex. We don't really know what the direction of causality is.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It could just be correlation. But it all gets ultra interesting when you start to tack together  " }, 

{ "sentence": " willpower, the taking on of new things, learning things in neuroplasticity and lifespan. And it may  " }, 

{ "sentence": " be that that quadfecta represents what we think of as the will to live is associated with an intense  " }, 

{ "sentence": " curiosity and desire to bring in new ideas and modes of thinking. And new ideas and modes of thinking then  " }, 

{ "sentence": " feed back on our feelings of how we could gain reward, internal reward, of course dopamine being the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " universal currency of reward, as a means to move forward. What does this mean? This means that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everybody, I believe, can become a better human being by taking on challenges. What is a challenge  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that can grow the anterior mid-cingulate cortex? Well, unfortunately, it's a challenge that you don't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " want to engage in. So if you love running, it's not going to do it. If you love resistance training,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's not going to do it. If you don't want to meditate in the morning and you do five minutes  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or 10 minutes of meditation, then you just enhance the activation of your anterior mid-cingulate  " }, 

{ "sentence": " cortex. So it's not just about doing hard things, it's about really pushing through resistance.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And the reason I bring this up now, as opposed to in a discussion about like how to get more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " tenacious or have stronger willpower, it will do that. Okay. We know that when the anterior mid-cingulate  " }, 

{ "sentence": " cortex gets bigger, it translates to a lot of different areas of challenge, not just the area  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in which you challenged it. The reason is I believe that this lofty notion of humans evolving to more  " }, 

{ "sentence": " collective thinking, to embracing new ways to bridge divides that harm human beings at scale or just  " }, 

{ "sentence": " locally, is going to emerge only through the willingness to embrace the internal friction that is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " hearing things and seeing things that we don't like and being able to take a stance of adaptive  " }, 

{ "sentence": " response, whatever that is. Now, of course, there are things that we hear and see and don't like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that activate enough of a sense of injustice in us that that's all it does. It just brings us to the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " point of like wanting to impart justice. But what I'm talking about here are differences in opinion,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " strongly polarized views that lead to all sorts of things, as we know, good and bad and everything in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " between. And if people had the capacity to feel that friction and to stay in a mode of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " some open cognition, I think we would come up with novel solutions. I really think the next iteration  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of human beings is collective consciousness. You know, it sounds lofty, sounds woo, but it's basically  " }, 

{ "sentence": " lots of minds working together, even minds that oppose one another in ideology, as a means to find out  " }, 

{ "sentence": " novel solutions to hard problems that vex us all and that in some cases really harm us all. It's a real  " }, 

{ "sentence": " thing with real possibility, but it's going to require that we all get not necessarily tougher, but  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that we get more resilient at the level of being able to tolerate internal states that normally would  " }, 

{ "sentence": " impede adaptive thinking. Yes, yes. And the ability to engage in uncomfortable thinking. And I love  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that definition that you gave. I saw this brilliant quote the other day on social media, and it was from  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a Christian page or a post, and it said, the essence of Christianity is not learning to love Jesus,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but learning to love Judas. And I was thinking how brilliant that was because it goes back to that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " point of what's uncomfortable. Like it's easy to love the good person. It's learning to love or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " understand at least the person who may have done, you know, something that you didn't recognize or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " didn't understand or didn't fully connect with. And I think often we see that and we think, oh, but then  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there's no accountability. There's no this, there's no that. But really what we're saying is, are we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " willing to do, as you said, the most challenging thing, which is something you don't enjoy doing?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's not something you're excited by. If you're enjoying the challenge, it's no longer the challenge,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right? It's always like, I remember a training and conditioning coach used to tell me like, Jay,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " if you're sitting in the cold plunge just to get your minutes up so you can tell someone how long you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " sat in there, he goes, then that means it wasn't hard beyond that certain point. It was like, you should  " }, 

{ "sentence": " get out once it's easy because it's not having the effect you want it to have.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " That's right. It's no longer an adaptive stimulus.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Correct. Yeah.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Can I offer an alternative protocol?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Please.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " People always ask me how cold should the cold plunge be or the cold shower and how long should I stay in?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And it's so variable depending on the person, the time of day, obviously only do what's safe,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right? So don't go so cold that you can, you know, you can get a cardiovascular effect that's not good,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but it's very simple. Actually, if you want it to translate into the real world in the best way,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you ask yourself right before you get in on a scale of one to 10, how badly do I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " not want to get in? And I would say that if it's five to 10, well, that's a wall.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " If it's anywhere in the five, that that's one wall you have to get over. So then you get in. And then  " }, 

{ "sentence": " at some point there will be the desire to get out. That's the second wall. Maybe it comes within  " }, 

{ "sentence": " five seconds. Maybe it comes within 20 seconds. That's the second wall. So what I would do is count  " }, 

{ "sentence": " walls. What are the quote unquote walls? The walls are, are waves of adrenaline being released into  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your body. And sometimes they are very close together, those waves. And sometimes they're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " more distantly spaced apart. Now, of course, at some point you go numb and then you don't feel  " }, 

{ "sentence": " them anymore. We don't suggest that. But if you think to yourself, gosh, today, I really don't  " }, 

{ "sentence": " want to get in. That wall is a really tall wall. Well, just getting in for 15, 20 seconds is going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to accomplish something meaningful for this anterior mid-cingulate cortex. It's going to accomplish  " }, 

{ "sentence": " something meaningful for the adrenaline release that you're going to experience.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So it's less about the temperature. I mean, obviously the temperature plays a role  " }, 

{ "sentence": " than it is your subjective relationship to the whole thing. For instance, if you do cold exposure  " }, 

{ "sentence": " at night when you're tired, it's a far and away different experience than in the morning after  " }, 

{ "sentence": " going for a run and you're too warm. So I can't say 45 degrees Fahrenheit for 90 seconds. Although if  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you want to start there, that's fine, provided it's safe for you. But as you watch these walls of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " adrenaline come at you, as it were, pay attention to what they feel like. That's what you'll recognize  " }, 

{ "sentence": " outside the ice bath in a hard conversation. It's not that you can make yourself so resilient  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that your adrenaline system doesn't work. It's that you learn to recognize the state of having  " }, 

{ "sentence": " adrenaline in your system and staying calm. And then I actually had this happen the other day.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I was in a really hard, yesterday, in a hard conversation, something first thing in the morning,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it was like, wait, what? Seriously? Misunderstanding, hard conversation. And I remember,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " here we are, our voices are going up. We weren't yelling, but like it was a peaceful morning  " }, 

{ "sentence": " until that moment. And we were, you could kind of feel the energy in the room going up. And I was  " }, 

{ "sentence": " thinking to myself, okay, how am I? And I thought, oh, this is like a wall in the thing. And I said,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and I said, because we have this, this language at home, I said, I feel like there's a wall of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " adrenaline hitting us with it. We both kind of started laughing and then we kind of reverted to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what we were doing and then we calmed down. And, you know, we talk about taking breaks and that's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " wonderful. It's a wonderful tool that you talked about in your book on relationships. There's so many  " }, 

{ "sentence": " valuable tools in there, by the way. I just like, thank you for writing that book. So valuable.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Everyone should read it. It should be standard curriculum, standard curriculum in every school,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in every home. I really mean that. Jay doesn't tell me to say this. I really mean this. I really  " }, 

{ "sentence": " truly mean it. You too, kind. The, well, it's entirely appropriate because it's true. But  " }, 

{ "sentence": " noticing those walls of adrenaline and realizing that when we're in those  " }, 

{ "sentence": " adrenaline filled states, our cognition is shifted. We don't have solutions that we had five minutes ago.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So learning to watch those pass in the cold plunge, in the cold shower, on a hard run or whatever it is,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but the cold seems to be the universal stressful stimulus for everybody, is so valuable. More than  " }, 

{ "sentence": " marking off, you know, 15 minutes or five minutes in the cold plunge. And some days it's 15 seconds,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " sometimes it's 30. And for somebody learning the cold plunge, it's like, hey, can you just even get  " }, 

{ "sentence": " near the thing or in it? And I think there's real value there. So in any event. But I know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I love that translation into real life because I think what's happened is we're dealing with a lot of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everyday things with so much pain that that pain is then creating more pain for us, for others. And we  " }, 

{ "sentence": " never end this, or we create this never ending cycle and loop for ourselves and others where we stay in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the pain. And what we're all saying is, what does it take, just as we have to learn to sit in that cold  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and regulate ourselves and adapt, what does it take to sit in the pain outside of the tub,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " regulate ourselves, rise to a place of peace, and then respond and then get together. And as you said,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the league of reasonable people, like, I think we'd all aspire towards that. I think when I hear that,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think we all go, I think I'm a reasonable person. I think most of us would say that.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think it lives in all of us. And it's a brain state that takes certain things to get to on a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " regular basis. I mean, there's some people that perhaps are outside the margins for which participation  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in the league of reasonable people is impossible. But even as I say that, you know, one thing that I've  " }, 

{ "sentence": " tried to do as I get older is to limit cynicism. You know, in my home growing up, there were many  " }, 

{ "sentence": " beautiful emotions and concepts and things I was exposed to by virtue of the wonderful people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that my parents were. They had flaws like everybody else. But one of the things that I've really tried  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to discard as I've gotten older is cynicism. It's one of the things that my sister and I talk a lot  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about. Like, it never served anyone well to be cynical. You can be critical and discerning,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but cynical doesn't accomplish anything except to separate us from people. That's my belief.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'm not trying to encourage people to be soft in a way that's unsafe for them.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Like I said, be discerning. You know, safety is important. But cynicism, I don't know what it is.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's like an ego-fed negativity that sort of implies one is better than other people, but it actually is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " usually the opposite. It usually comes from a place of deep insecurity, right? It's a very dismissive  " }, 

{ "sentence": " stance. And so I almost caught myself a second ago saying, oh, you know, making a kind of joke about,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's a cynical joke about, well, there are probably people who can't. I actually believe that we are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " all capable of having access to this reasonable feature within ourselves, but it involves a state  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of calm, a feeling of safety. And, you know, I guess, you know, laced into everything I'm saying  " }, 

{ "sentence": " today is a kind of a hope and an aspiration. Yeah. You know, I've kind of gotten to the point  " }, 

{ "sentence": " now where I feel like if I don't say it now, when am I going to say it? And how old do you have to be?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I used to think you had to be 40 years old to write a book. I thought that. I thought I have to be 40  " }, 

{ "sentence": " years old to write a book. And I realized that's ridiculous. People much younger than 40 write  " }, 

{ "sentence": " amazing books, amazing and important books. And then I thought, well, how old do you have to be  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in order to have had enough life experience to be able to say things that are aspirational about how  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you'd like to see the world change or people change for the better? And, you know, I've decided  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that the age on that is one day, you know, like one day. So this is a bit of an encouragement for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people out there. If you have ideas about ways that you and others can be better to really  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like write them down and evolve them, right? They often need some evolution to be able to be received  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in the right way. But then share those. I was thinking a moment ago, I wanted your opinion on  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this. So in thinking about emotional interaction and the ways in which the world can be beautiful  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or challenging, depending on the energy that's around us. I once read, I forget his name, so forgive  " }, 

{ "sentence": " me. He's an investor. I think it was on the Tim Ferriss podcast, a very successful investor,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " young guy. I think he lived in Truckee of all places. He once said, you know, email is a public  " }, 

{ "sentence": " post to-do list. And it completely changed in that one moment, the way that I thought about email,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because the emails were useful, but then I realized, oh yeah, I'm like going in there and it's like all  " }, 

{ "sentence": " these things I need to do. And when I started my laboratory, I knew I had two major  " }, 

{ "sentence": " challenges. One, get grants so I could do the work. You need money to do research, publish great  " }, 

{ "sentence": " papers. And that meant I had to interact with my lab and do a bunch of other things. Other things  " }, 

{ "sentence": " were important, teaching included, but those were the main ones. Email was a public post to-do list,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so I needed to be very careful in terms of my interaction with email. Nowadays, I feel like social  " }, 

{ "sentence": " media is a public, not necessarily projection, but evacuation of emotion. So when I go on to social  " }, 

{ "sentence": " media in the morning, if I'm not careful, like really careful and thoughtful about what I look at,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm basically getting the emotional energy of all these people. And some of them, like you,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are trying to help people. And some of them are just in evacuated expression of their pain. Others are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in evacuated expression of cynicism. And I don't think I'm alone in this. Like I'm a pretty sensitive  " }, 

{ "sentence": " person or maybe I'm getting more sensitive, but I'm very sensitive to this stuff. Like, it's not  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like it can throw off my whole day, but I can quickly get drawn down a rabbit hole of something.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And then we talk about dopamine hits or the addictive properties of social media,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and that would be a fine conversation, but that one's been had. But what about all the like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " energetic bombardment and that the need for discernment and filtering of all this stuff?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I wish, you know, I could label up like a positivity score and it's not to avoid the realities  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of the world. But I think, I don't know, does this stuff affect you? Because I do my work so that it  " }, 

{ "sentence": " doesn't permeate me. But, you know, just like if someone wakes up in a bad mood, you can take care of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " them. But if they wake up in a bad mood every single day, it's pretty draining on your home environment.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " For sure. So what do you do in order to keep emotional boundaries, especially online?  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And the funny thing is the predictability of negativity doesn't reduce its effect.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Well, it also has a gravitational pull. I mean, I'm on X and Instagram and the other,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know, threads and Facebook and all of them, you know. But I noticed that on some of the platforms  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in particular, like there's a gravitational pull, like people are there to fight. And now when I  " }, 

{ "sentence": " look at that, I think, you know, some of them are saying highly intelligent things. Some of them are  " }, 

{ "sentence": " not. But like, they got to have a lot of pain inside.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think that's what I was going to touch on. I think it's that, to me, the thing that has been  " }, 

{ "sentence": " most helpful in all of it is a genuine sense of deeper empathy and compassion for the energetic  " }, 

{ "sentence": " state of the world, the systems that have let people down and truly made them feel that they  " }, 

{ "sentence": " can't rely on them. And the systems that have done a disservice and injustice, which has now led to this  " }, 

{ "sentence": " emotional evacuation, as you called it. And to me, using it as a way of having deeper empathy,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " deeper compassion, a genuine sense of recognition that although everyone does have choice and does  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have agency, definitely, there is an overarching energetic system that is almost keeping people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " imprisoned in this space. And that prison is now addictive to stay in. I feel for that. I deeply  " }, 

{ "sentence": " feel for that. And it affects me because I recognize that people haven't been set up for success  " }, 

{ "sentence": " by the education system, by the way the economy is set up, by the way anything is set up. Like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's not set people up for success. And not truly for people in their home, they weren't,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a lot of people weren't set up for success. And so we have to zoom out and look at the context,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because if I zoom in and just look at that one tweet or that one comment, God, it's like a bullet  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to the chest, you know? And it's like, I've always had this vision and I've kind of done it mentally  " }, 

{ "sentence": " sometimes because I can't do it physically. And for every person that feels that way, I've always  " }, 

{ "sentence": " wanted, I was like, I wish I could sit down with every person individually who felt a certain way  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and have a contextually relevant, honest, authentic conversation with each person  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and bare my soul and be vulnerable and open my heart. But we can't. And I also know that one post  " }, 

{ "sentence": " can't do that for everyone. Like, it's not possible for one quote, one image, one message,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " one podcast episode that will speak to everyone to make everyone feel seen, heard, and understood. I could  " }, 

{ "sentence": " just about do that on a one-to-one level, let alone a one-to-100 million level. How are you going to do  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that? And so I also have empathy for myself. And I extend that compassion back to myself and recognize  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'm a limited human being who just as that individual is limited by their systems and their  " }, 

{ "sentence": " setup and their energy, so am I. And there's no way in which I could respond to this individual and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " satisfy this exchange with 140, 280 characters. Like, how's that even possible? And so I think to me,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " deepening my compassion and empathy externally and internally have been the only relevant tools,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " as woo-woo or as spiritual as they may sound, because there is no practical habit-based solution  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that I can give you some tactics and ideas, but I know as well that at one point they're just logical  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and theoretical and practical, but they're not, yeah, they don't feel, they don't hit me there. And so  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to me, I've seen it all as a simulation and an experiment to deepen human emotion,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " deepen human empathy, deepen human compassion,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and a reminder of my fallibility so that I can embrace my own insignificance,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so that I can therefore take shelter in the source and the universe and God,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and to allow for space for that. If I was able to control every one of these things and make it work  " }, 

{ "sentence": " perfectly, I may, in a very crude sense, you may, under false pretenses, stop believing you're the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " controller to some degree. And I think anyone who's experienced success in certain domains  " }, 

{ "sentence": " starts to feel like the controller in their relevant fields. And I think all of these things  " }, 

{ "sentence": " are expedited in order just to encourage you to have an ego death and pulverize the arrogance of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " whatever kind, by the way. I don't mean in a sense of that I feel I'm important, but we all have a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " sense of I'm the controller. I can make things work. I know what's right. I'm this, I'm that. And this  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is all reminding us of we're not the controller. We have to ultimately take shelter. We have to ultimately  " }, 

{ "sentence": " give up the reins. And I ultimately have to surrender and accept that there is a greater source,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " there is a greater power, and that when I'm in connection with that and I'm in service of that,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " then I'm happy and I'm joyful. But if I'm trying to be that or extrapolate energy from that to control  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and navigate, then I'm forever going to be unhappy. So to me, that's a quick version of the stuff that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I try and work on not to be helpless. I don't feel helpless in that. I feel, I feel at home.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's almost like, you know, when you're taking shelter of a greater source to take care of things  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you can't take care of. It's not because you're helpless or because you're weak. It's actually the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " greatest sign of strength to know I can call up a friend to help me. You know, am I more strong  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because I can move home myself and not ask anyone for help? Or am I stronger because three of my  " }, 

{ "sentence": " friends came and helped me out and carry the load? I'm stronger for asking for help. I have a better  " }, 

{ "sentence": " community and network. You'd say that person's smarter and healthier. And so I think of that same  " }, 

{ "sentence": " way on a universal level. At least I tried to, I'm working on it. I love that. And I realized from  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what you said that, you know, the greatest sense of safety seems to arrive from not trying to control  " }, 

{ "sentence": " everything and it it's counterintuitive, right? You know, we, we think, okay, well, how do you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " get safety? Well, you have to get rid of vigilance. How do you get rid of vigilance? Well,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you decide what you do and don't have to pay attention to. And at some point, if one decides,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I can't control all of this. You have one of two options. Either that means you're just waiting for  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that wave to come demolish you wave of whatever, or you trust, like you, you trust in something to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " make everything. Okay. Even if that wave comes, you know, and I've talked before on podcasts. I,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I believe in God. I do, you know, and, and of course I believe in everyone's right to believe  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or not believe what they believe in. I think that the notion of, of giving up,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " trying to control everything and giving over control to more universal forces or a universal  " }, 

{ "sentence": " force, whatever one's mode of thinking happens to be, I believe they're entitled to is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " probably the most peace inducing step I've ever taken. And I thought it would be, you know, matched  " }, 

{ "sentence": " with a little sneaking, you know, voice in the back. Yeah. But, but it's not. And, and I don't know  " }, 

{ "sentence": " how that works at the level of neuroscience. I know there are neuroscientists who are trying to explore  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this. And as the data evolve, I I'll certainly pay attention to it. Not with the intention of trying to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " undermine any kind of, um, larger sense of, of anything. Um, but just out of interest. For sure.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I'd love to see it. I'd love to see it. It's far too interesting. There's actually a woman at, at  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Stanford. I haven't yet to talk to her. We should both talk to her. She said, uh, I forget her name  " }, 

{ "sentence": " at the moment, um, because I just learned about her work in the department of anthropology who has  " }, 

{ "sentence": " spent her entire career studying, um, people's inner voices, people who hear voices, people who hear the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " voices of others. And sure, this sometimes goes into the domain of people who have auditory  " }, 

{ "sentence": " hallucinations and so forth, but also just these different scripts that people have in their, in their mind  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that include their own voices and other voices, voices we've internalized from childhood. This  " }, 

{ "sentence": " resonates with me a lot because when I was a kid, after my parents would put me to sleep, I used to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " arrange dialogues between people I had heard that day and I could hear their voices in very clear  " }, 

{ "sentence": " ways in my head. And I would remember things they said and I could create these dialogues. And so I've  " }, 

{ "sentence": " also always had a very like strong audiographic memory. It's not as if everything I hear, I remember  " }, 

{ "sentence": " verbatim that actually would be a super skill would have saved me in a lot of arguments. Um,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but in all seriousness, I think what you describe about essentially a letting go or a giving over  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of the, the need for the control that we all experienced, the desire for control is really where  " }, 

{ "sentence": " the solution lies. I think I know this because many people have said it and it's very hard to do,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but that once one does it once, you know, you can do it again. Yeah. And it's a practice.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " It's a practice. It's not, it's not a, you write it down and it's done. It's a practice.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And, you know, I also am thinking about the, the kind of, uh, counterintuitive nature of the fact  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that, you know, we're talking at once about letting go and not trying to control everything, but also  " }, 

{ "sentence": " pushing oneself to be more resilient and tenacious and things of that sort. And so I, I feel like all of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " life is like that. All of life is about, yes, you need to take care of your physiology. You need to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " get your sleep at night, but it's also okay to get a bad night's sleep every once in a while. It's okay  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to not do every protocol. In fact, it's encouraged to not do every protocol. The expectation on us is  " }, 

{ "sentence": " not perfection, right? It's, it's, I think being able to toggle between these different states.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I think that one of the best things about social media, one of the best things about podcasts  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is that, you know, speaking and listening is the human narrative. Certainly writing certainly  " }, 

{ "sentence": " plays poetry and music as well. Dance, there are other forms of communication, certainly sculpture.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And here we go on and on, but as a great podcaster, David Senra, who hosts the Founders podcast,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's kind of a, like a nerd's podcast of if somebody's interested in founders, like founders of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " companies that he sort of does for that, what I do for science and health and what you do for health  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and spirituality and so many more topics, psychology and so on. David does for founders and company  " }, 

{ "sentence": " founders. And he said, you know, that podcasting and to some extent social media, but really podcasting  " }, 

{ "sentence": " is the human narrative of recorded radio. Radio used to be live. Sometimes it was recorded and then  " }, 

{ "sentence": " played, but there wasn't an archive that you could go access. And where there was, it was a  " }, 

{ "sentence": " fairly sparse archive. I think we're going to look back a hundred years from now and whether it's in AI  " }, 

{ "sentence": " form or in its traditional form as it is now, I think people speaking onto the internet is our, you know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " this is our stone tablets. These are cave drawings. Definitely. It's wild. It's wild. It's wild.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Yeah. And, and I like to think it's serving the evolution of our species at, at some level.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Certainly it's creating a historical record. I often think about this, like so many thoughts,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " so many emotions that people have don't get transmuted into useful tools that others could  " }, 

{ "sentence": " benefit from. I think this is why we love music and poetry and things that capture an essence. Actually,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I recall now, this is what I wanted to ask you about. Lately, I try, I spend real time trying to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " feel experiences more than just think about them. I have a very like, you know, kind of dominant  " }, 

{ "sentence": " analytic mind. I'm trying to think, strategize, understand, make sense of, I've always been like  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that. But in recent years, and especially this last year, I've just tried to like sense what's going  " }, 

{ "sentence": " on outside me and in me. And this form of intelligence is something that people have  " }, 

{ "sentence": " talked about for hundreds of thousands of years. It's a different form of intelligence. It's the one  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that I think has access to our unconscious mind in a way that thinking doesn't always have access to.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Mm-hmm. It's not necessarily linked to emotion. It's just more of a, are we drawn toward, away from,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or are we kind of neutral about a given person or experience? And it draws on a different set of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " neural circuits. And I started thinking about this in large part because of my love of dogs,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you know, my dog, Costello, I put down in July of 2021. And I always loved the bulldog because the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " first time I ever went to a dog show, which everybody should do, by the way. You ever  " }, 

{ "sentence": " been to a dog show? No, I've never been. We should go. So I was taken to a dog show by my  " }, 

{ "sentence": " then girlfriend when I was a postdoc. And she said, you got to go to a dog show. And it was,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and so we went to the dog show, but we didn't attend the show. In front is the show where they're  " }, 

{ "sentence": " going over things and walking around, getting paraded around. That part's cool. But the really cool  " }, 

{ "sentence": " part is you go in the back where you have all the dog breeders with all the different breeds of dogs,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " usually five or six of each breed. And you can see the immense variation, both in the structure,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but also the temperaments and therefore the nervous systems of these different animals,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " all the same species. Also dogs, by the way, you have little ones and you have giant ones,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " chihuahuas and great Danes in the same species. As far as I know, it's the greatest variation in  " }, 

{ "sentence": " brain and body size of any species. There's probably, you know, another species out there that someone  " }, 

{ "sentence": " will point out that, you know, makes me wrong, but it's at least the far end of the continuum in that  " }, 

{ "sentence": " sense. So I'm back there and I'm thinking, I really want a dog at some point. And I'm thinking,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I want a Rhodesian Ridgeback, or I really like the, you know, the Wolfhounds. I really love the Afghans.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " They look like people in dog suits, the way they will move around and so, so bright eyed. And then  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I looked over in the corner and there's this row of bulldogs snoring like a xylophone.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I went over and I asked the woman there, I said, an interesting breed of dog. And she said,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " oh, they're the best. And I said, well, everyone here says that about their breed of dog. And she  " }, 

{ "sentence": " said, yeah, but they're really the sweetest and they are the essence of efficiency. And so I woke  " }, 

{ "sentence": " one up and I started playing with it. And you realize that they don't react unless they need to. Some  " }, 

{ "sentence": " have more energy than others, but when they need to, they have a lot of energy available to them,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but they have very little spontaneous movement. Now I'm not like this. I think I'm probably becoming  " }, 

{ "sentence": " more like this as the years go by through some effort, but other breeds of dogs are constantly  " }, 

{ "sentence": " moving. They're like peripatetic. They're constantly moving. They're constantly moving.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And it makes me a little nervous. Whereas the bulldog just made me feel very calm.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So I got Costello, not that day. I got him elsewhere. And I found that his presence,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " even his loud snoring made me very calm. And he was not reactive to things that did not require  " }, 

{ "sentence": " reactivity to. He was reactive when appropriate. And I'm not saying the bulldog is the perfect breed.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " In fact, I discourage people from getting them unless they have the means to take care of them  " }, 

{ "sentence": " because they tend to have a lot of health issues. They're very inbred. It's kind of a cruel breed,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " especially in its modern iterations. But every dog has a different energy. So pay attention to how  " }, 

{ "sentence": " much spontaneous movement there is. Pay attention to where they put their eyes,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " how readily they just go to sleep or not, how quickly they stand up and move. And then start  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to look at people and you start to realize there's tremendous variation there. There's a bright eyedness  " }, 

{ "sentence": " to certain people. You're one of them. Like really at the level of their eyes that are there with you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And that also exude a feeling of calm. And so I started paying more attention to how things make me  " }, 

{ "sentence": " feel. And I think this is why going on social media now, I feel like I'm eating 25 different  " }, 

{ "sentence": " cuisines at once, which would be disgusting. Whereas if I just kind of focus on one or two things,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like I love different cuisine, different types of food, but I don't want them all at once.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And so I think as humans, we are meant to experience a huge array of what life has to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " offer and people have to offer. Not all of it, but a lot of it. And I feel like being able to sense  " }, 

{ "sentence": " into kind of the essence of music or the essence of a person's presence or the essence of a group  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for me has been very informative toward just kind of like realizing there are these different ways of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " interacting with the world. I don't want to sound too abstract here. I think what we're really  " }, 

{ "sentence": " talking about here is turning off traditional modes of thinking, which tend to be single track  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or dual track and sensing energy, I think is more about taking a broader band analysis of what's  " }, 

{ "sentence": " going on, more visual field, more sensory field and bringing it all in at once. And this is what  " }, 

{ "sentence": " we at least understand other animals to do because they lack language, at least in our form. And so  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they have to make decisions about moving toward, away from, or staying in a neutral position based on  " }, 

{ "sentence": " a kind of gestalt, a kind of like a whole picture of something. And I think it can be a very useful  " }, 

{ "sentence": " rudder with which to navigate. Now, of course, we also have to sharpen our attention and sharpen our  " }, 

{ "sentence": " intellect around certain things. But I think as time goes on, I'm, I don't know, I'm trying to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " become more bulldog like for myself and for the people in my life. Yeah. Because Costello made me  " }, 

{ "sentence": " feel safe. Certainly made me feel accepted. He was very stubborn, but he also, he took great delight  " }, 

{ "sentence": " in, in things. And he also could be quite the protector if he needed to be. And so I really thought  " }, 

{ "sentence": " like, wow, if ever there were some energies to embody, it would be the bulldog energy. And maybe  " }, 

{ "sentence": " for other people, they need to embody a different energy. I think we can learn a lot by paying  " }, 

{ "sentence": " attention to animals. You know, I, like I said, I spent some time with Rick Rubin and I won't compare  " }, 

{ "sentence": " him to a bulldog. He's not like a bulldog. He's like, he's like a wolfhound. He's extremely still.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But then when he opens his mouth, that mind is, it's like, it's a force. And I know Rick  " }, 

{ "sentence": " well enough to know that he has this amazing ability to get very close to the energy of music  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and other people, but he doesn't get absorbed by it. It doesn't change him in a way that changes  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your experience of him. He's having experiences, but like there's a stability to him. He's like this  " }, 

{ "sentence": " cord of, of reliability. And I think that's one of the reasons why people gravitate towards  " }, 

{ "sentence": " him. It's also that beard is pretty iconic. And your energy too, my friend, I haven't figured out  " }, 

{ "sentence": " what animal you are. I'm looking forward to hearing about it. I haven't figured it out,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but it's, you're very loving, but you're also very discerning. I think this is something that people  " }, 

{ "sentence": " probably don't realize about you. I'm not a psychologist, but you know, but you, you know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you, you, you have a gift, you have a gift and you give your gift in such plentiful ways and so  " }, 

{ "sentence": " many people benefit. And so you've also clearly learned to surround yourself with people that allow  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you to give and to receive. I say this with great admiration. I think I know you well enough now to like,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I know your heart. Like I, and I'd hope so. Yeah. Yeah. I can feel it. Like I can feel  " }, 

{ "sentence": " your love for what you do and how badly you want people to get it, but you know better than to  " }, 

{ "sentence": " do anything, but just create an offering. And as a consequence, people flock to it.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I love it. I love it. And, and I've grown tremendously from your books, from your teaching.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I tell you this offline. So I'm, I'm now saying it, I'm now saying it recorded because I think  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it's really important that people understand that the podcasters, especially like whether  " }, 

{ "sentence": " or not it's you or Rick or Lex or, and there's so many others, right. Or Joe or Tim or Whitney or  " }, 

{ "sentence": " whoever, like there's so many, too many to list. Like we're all just being ourselves. That's the beauty  " }, 

{ "sentence": " of it. It's like Costello being Costello. And to some extent, sure. There's, you know,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " edits and production and all that kind of stuff, but it's just you being you. And to me, that's the  " }, 

{ "sentence": " most beautiful thing. Yeah. It's what really works. And it's what really matters. And I think it's what  " }, 

{ "sentence": " people should do even when there's no recording. You certainly do, you know, you're the same on mic  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and off mic. It's one of the things I love about you. And I think it's what people, we need to do.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " We all need to like also embrace that unique wiring that we each have. So.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Absolutely. Well, Andrew, thank you for those kind words. And I don't take them lightly. I know  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you mean them. And what I really appreciate today is you've also shared the part of you that comes  " }, 

{ "sentence": " out naturally when we're together and same with me, the part of me that's fascinated by neuroscience  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and everything you teach. And I think that's the beauty of it too. It's that I hope that everyone  " }, 

{ "sentence": " who's been listening and watching today knows and loves you for what you do on a daily basis,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " but then can accept that there are different facets to you. There are different elements to you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " There are different things that you're curious about. And you've shown them all today  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and laid them out. When they come to Huberman Lab, they're getting something very specific and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " they're getting that part. But you allow yourself to showcase different parts of your personality.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And I'm grateful that you shared that with me. You shared that with my community.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I want to thank you for joining me today and being so open and vulnerable and giving with your space  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and energy. And I'm glad that you feel confident and open enough to be able to do that because  " }, 

{ "sentence": " it goes back to everything we've discussed today. We all want to feel safe and accepted.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " But in order to do that, we want all parts of ourself to be accepted. Otherwise, we can't truly feel  " }, 

{ "sentence": " safe. And so if I'm only accepted for one part of me, then I don't feel safe. And I feel safe only  " }, 

{ "sentence": " sharing one part of myself, then I'm not truly accepted. And so I think everything we've talked  " }, 

{ "sentence": " about today comes around beautifully, full circle. And thank you for making me feel safe and accepted.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Thank you for being safe and accepted. And I hope everyone who's listening and watching today  " }, 

{ "sentence": " focuses on doing that for themselves and the people they love. That would be a beautiful  " }, 

{ "sentence": " ripple effect from this show that people go off and create that space for the people in their lives.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " So thank you, my friend.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " Well, thank you so much. Thanks for having me. And as I said, I'm such a huge fan of what you do and  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and who you are. And, you know, and thank you for the kind words. You know, I confess I have a bit of  " }, 

{ "sentence": " low level anxiety and sharing parts of myself I haven't shared publicly before. But since I was a kid,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I was one to venture out a little bit further than the rest, usually with a pack, but sometimes alone.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And, you know, I'm trying to embrace positive change in myself by example. I mean, I am fallible  " }, 

{ "sentence": " and flawed like everybody. I have areas that still need work, certainly. And I'm going to keep working  " }, 

{ "sentence": " away and sharing what I learn. And I'm grateful for all of it. And I'm especially grateful to you  " }, 

{ "sentence": " right now. So thank you, my friend. Thank you, Andrew. Appreciate you. Thank you so much.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " If this is the year that you're trying to get creative, you're trying to build more,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " I need you to listen to this episode with Rick Rubin on how to break into your most creative self,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " how to use unconventional methods that lead to success, and the secret to genuinely loving what  " }, 

{ "sentence": " you do. If you're trying to find your passion and your lane, Rick Rubin's episode is the one for you.  " }, 

{ "sentence": " And just because I like it, that doesn't give it any value. Like as an artist, if you like it,  " }, 

{ "sentence": " that's all of the value. That's the success comes when you say, I like this enough for other people to see it.  " }
