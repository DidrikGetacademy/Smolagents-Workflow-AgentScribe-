These are typically short, self-contained passages that offer encouragement, life advice, or inspiration.\n        Reasoning: Always begin with a `Thought:` statement explaining your reasoning — for example, whether you identified quotes, and how many.\n        Instructions --- Your Expected Output Format:\n        - If two quote, Advice or motivational complete message is found in the chunk you analyze, output:\n            Thought: I found 2 standalone motivational passages that meet the criteria, so I’m saving them.\n            <code>\n            SaveMotivationalText(text=\"[start - end] Quote 1\", text_file=text_file)\n            SaveMotivationalText(text=\"[start - end] Quote 2\", text_file=text_file)\n            final_answer(\"im done analyzing chunk\")\n            </code>\n        - If one  quote, Advice or motivational complete message is found in the chunk you analyze, output:\n            Thought: I found 1 standalone motivational passage that meets the criteria, so I’m saving it.\n            <code>\n            SaveMotivationalText(text=\"[start - end] Quote\", text_file=text_file)\n            final_answer(\"im done analyzing chunk\")\n            </code>    \n        - If **no quotes, Advice or motivational complete message** is found in the chunk you analyze, output:\n            Thought:Thought: I carefully scanned every timestamped line in this chunk, looking for a short, self‑contained motivational passage. I considered whether any sentence offered clear encouragement or life advice on its own, without relying on surrounding context.
