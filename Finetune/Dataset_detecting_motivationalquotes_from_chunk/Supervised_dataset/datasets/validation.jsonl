I considered whether any sentence offered clear encouragement or life advice on its own, without relying on surrounding context. None of the lines met the criteria of a standalone inspirational quote—they were either filler commentary, generic statements, or fragments. Since there isn’t a complete motivational statement I can save, I will not call SaveMotivationalText. and only provide `final_answer`\n            <code>\n            final_answer(\"After carefully analyzing the chunk/text, I have concluded nothing can be saved.\")\n            </code>\n\n        ### Notes:\n        - Quotes must be **motivational** and **standalone** — avoid fragments or generic sentences.\n        - Always include both `Thought:` and `<code>` blocks.\n        - Use exact function names and punctuation as shown.\n        - Do not return quotes that are incomplete or unclear.\n        - o not create multiple SaveMotivationalText() calls for each line in a single quote.\n        - Do not alter or guess missing timestamps — use the exact start and end values provided in the lines that contain the quote.\n        - Quote text should appear as a single, continuous string, even if it was originally split across 2–3 lines.\n                        \n        ##Timestamp Handling:\n        When a quote spans multiple lines (each line containing a separate timestamp):\n            - Merge the lines into a single quote.\n            - Include the **start time from the first line** and the **end time from the last line**.\n            - Preserve original spacing and punctuation.\n            - Output the full quote like:\n\n        Exsample identified quote from chunk:\n        [chunk start]\n        [620.10s - 622.40s] In today's episode, we'll cover some important updates about mental clarity\n        [622.41s - 623.69s] But before that, thank you for supporting the channel\n        [623.70s - 627.11s] You will encounter many challenges in life  \n        [627.12s - 628.00s] But you must never be defeated by the challenges\n        [628.01s - 629.55s] That was a quote I heard recently and it really stuck with me\n        [629.56s - 631.00s] Anyway, let’s move on to the main topic of today’s discussion\n        [chunk end]\n\n        Your output should be:\n        Thought: I found 1 standalone motivational passages that meet the criteria, so I’m saving them.\n        <code>SaveMotivationalText(text=\"[623.70s - 628.00s] You will encounter many challenges in life  [627.12s - 628.00s] But you must never be defeated by the challenges\", text_file=text_file) final_answer(\"Im done analyzing the chunk\")</code>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Here is the chunk you will analyze:\n\n[chunk start]\n[600.00s - 602.77s] As well as, you know, pushing, again, pushing farther.\n[602.87s - 606.43s] Well, if, if it's three a.\n[606.53s - 609.32s] Well, one of the, uh, big scenes that a lot of people talk about is when, um, the director, Ishiro Honda,.\n[609.42s - 611.97s] call a soft opening soft open my special oh here you\n[612.07s - 614.76s] You know, where you have a better flow of ideas and just general better community.\n[614.86s - 617.75s] Do one thing every\n[617.85s - 620.58s] day that scares you\n[620.68s - 623.32s] Why is it so different here than everywhere else, every other business, and why is that a good thing?.\n[623.42s - 626.87s] Well, I talked to her about your date.\n[626.97s - 629.60s] And, clearly, he was, it was semen that he was putting on her keyboard and mouse, too.\n[629.70s - 633.04s] I didn't have to say it\n[633.14s - 636.34s] Nothing ever really goes away--it\n[636.44s - 639.22s] just changes into something else Something beautiful\n[639.32s - 642.61s] So a few months into the new year, one of my friends is like, hey, I've been interning at this local theater in Orlando.\n[642.71s - 645.76s] I, I, first of all, whatever the news was saying about me, I already knew.\n[645.86s - 649.09s] So, this was before the, the recent, sort of, groundswell of support for podcasting.\n[chunk end]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thought: I found 2 standalone motivational passages that meet the criteria, so I’m saving them.\n<code>\nSaveMotivationalText(text=\"[614.86s - 617.75s] Do one thing every [617.85s - 620.58s] day that scares you\", text_file=text_file)\nSaveMotivationalText(text=\"[633.14s - 636.34s] Nothing ever really goes away--it [636.44s - 639.22s] just changes into something else Something beautiful\", text_file=text_file)\nfinal_answer(\"Im done analyzing the chunk\")\n</code>"}]}
