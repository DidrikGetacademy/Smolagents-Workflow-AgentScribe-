    "sentence": "you've been in it? I would say sometimes the"

  {
    "sentence": "30 days, right? 30 days of close that can be really"

  {
    "sentence": "Your seller. My seller. Yeah. So I talked to my"

  {
    "sentence": "seller and said, Hey, this is probably going to be an"

  {
    "sentence": "issue, but it's up to you. If I need to bring"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "this up to the agent or not, it's a legal"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "binding contract. And really they'd have no way to get out"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "of it unless there's a low appraisal at"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "this point. Right. Uh, it's also like, you know,"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "because now their inspection's not in play. Yeah."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Cause it's zero days. Um, and that and other"

  {
    "sentence": "things on the contract was not filled up properly. You"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "know, as a loan officer, I get things and I'm"

  {
    "sentence": "like, Hey, did you guys see this? And every once"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "in a while, both agents are like, Nope. And I'm"

  {
    "sentence": "like, well, I'm going to move on. Like that's not"

    "sentence": "there. And you guys need to work that out. Yeah."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "You know, cause I, I see those things too. I,"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "okay. So this question is kind of the same question,"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "but what's, what's the thing that you've learned"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "the most about being a broker owner that you're"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "shocked about how much time it takes on the"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "behind the scenes when it comes to the admin stuff,"

    "sentence": "like the people, the people, like I'm good at like"

    "sentence": "my agents calling me and getting back with them in"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "less than a couple hours. It's the admin."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "It's, um, especially since we grew so quick."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "So what do you think the most concerning thing"

  },
  {
    "sentence": "thing that I know you're like me, you don't"

    "sentence": "world today? Like you said, we don't worry about"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "a lot, but it's just, you got to learn how"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "to pivot. So haunting me, there's not much that haunts"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "me. I don't, I don't really know how to answer"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "that question. I mean, as, as of now, what I'm seeing"

  {
    "sentence": "last five days, it hurt some houses hit the"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "market to have a hundred some houses lowered their"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "prices. Are you saying we're almost like 2018, 2019?"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "Oh yeah. Totally. With the, with the interest rates"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "where they're at. Yep. High insurance, high"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "taxes. It's very limited. What people can do."

  {
    "sentence": "what? Your person's renting a house, your, your"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "landlord, you're going to pay for that because they"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "have to pay for that. So at that point, it's"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "like, okay, do I keep pissing away money that paying for"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "him to, to gain more equity or let's"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "go buy something. Right. Cause you're already paying"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "that anyways. Affordability is really becoming hard for"

  },
  {
    "sentence": "that insurance rates are going to go up another 20"

  },
  {
    "sentence": "I know that's, that's difficult for people. That's probably"

  {
    "sentence": "the most concerning thing for me as many years as"

  {
    "sentence": "I've been in the business. I just see it harder and"

    "sentence": "harder for the first time home buyer. But when"

    "sentence": "how to do it with a real affordability"

  },
  {
    "sentence": "multiple buyers on a single home, things like"
  },
  {
    "sentence": "that. But yeah, that's, that's probably the most"

    "sentence": "job she did, and, like, how she should never be a server anymore and go get a job somewhere else."
  },
  {
    "sentence": "And, like, she was so pissed."
