These are typically short, self-contained passages that offer encouragement, life advice, or inspiration.\n\n        ###  Reasoning:\n        Always begin with a `Thought:` statement explaining your reasoning — for example, whether you identified quotes, and how many.\n\n        ###Instructions --- Your Expected Output Format:\n        - If **two quote, Advice or motivational complete message** is found in the chunk you analyze, output:\n            Thought: I found 2 standalone motivational passages that meet the criteria, so I’m saving them.\n            <code>\n            SaveMotivationalText(text=\"[start - end] Quote 1\", text_file=text_file)\n            SaveMotivationalText(text=\"[start - end] Quote 2\", text_file=text_file)\n            final_answer(\"im done analyzing chunk\")\n            </code>\n\n        - If **one  quote, Advice or motivational complete message** is found in the chunk you analyze, output:\n            Thought: I found 1 standalone motivational passage that meets the criteria, so I’m saving it.\n            <code>\n            SaveMotivationalText(text=\"[start - end] Quote\", text_file=text_file)\n            final_answer(\"im done analyzing chunk\")\n            </code>\n            \n                \n        - If **no quotes, Advice or motivational complete message** is found in the chunk you analyze, output:\n            Thought:Thought: I carefully scanned every timestamped line in this chunk, looking for a short, self‑contained motivational passage. I considered whether any sentence offered clear encouragement or life advice on its own, without relying on surrounding context. None of the lines met the criteria of a standalone inspirational quote—they were either filler commentary, generic statements, or fragments. Since there isn’t a complete motivational statement I can save, I will not call SaveMotivationalText. and only provide `final_answer`\n            <code>\n            final_answer(\"After carefully analyzing the chunk/text, I have concluded nothing can be saved.\")\n            </code>\n\n        ### Notes:\n        - Quotes must be **motivational** and **standalone** — avoid fragments or generic sentences.\n        - Always include both `Thought:` and `<code>` blocks.\n        - Use exact function names and punctuation as shown.\n        - Do not return quotes that are incomplete or unclear.\n        - o not create multiple SaveMotivationalText() calls for each line in a single quote.\n        - Do not alter or guess missing timestamps — use the exact start and end values provided in the lines that contain the quote.\n        - Quote text should appear as a single, continuous string, even if it was originally split across 2–3 lines.\n                        \n        ##Timestamp Handling:\n        When a quote spans multiple lines (each line containing a separate timestamp):\n            - Merge the lines into a single quote.\n            - Include the **start time from the first line** and the **end time from the last line**.\n            - Preserve original spacing and punctuation.\n            - Output the full quote like:\n\n        Exsample identified quote from chunk:\n        [chunk start]\n        [620.10s - 622.40s] In today's episode, we'll cover some important updates about mental clarity\n        [622.41s - 623.69s] But before that, thank you for supporting the channel\n        [623.70s - 627.11s] You will encounter many challenges in life  \n        [627.12s - 628.00s] But you must never be defeated by the challenges\n        [628.01s - 629.55s] That was a quote I heard recently and it really stuck with me\n        [629.56s - 631.00s] Anyway, let’s move on to the main topic of today’s discussion\n        [chunk end]\n\n        Your output should be:\n\n        Thought: I found 1 standalone motivational passages that meet the criteria, so I’m saving them.\n        <code>SaveMotivationalText(text=\"[623.70s - 628.00s] You will encounter many challenges in life  [627.12s - 628.00s] But you must never be defeated by the challenges\", text_file=text_file) final_answer(\"Im done analyzing the chunk\")</code>\n\n\n        Here is the chunk you will analyze:\n\n[chunk start]\n[600.00s - 603.22s] Basically, um, his engineer was like, you know, Prince wants you to treat this as if it's your song, you know?
