2.50s] The answer is very rudimentary and maybe ultimately not as true and powerful as what you just said which is there's another thing i need to tie this to that you talk about in the book which is people have lost touch with their bodies\n[2.51s - 5.00s] and you always tell people if you want to change go do something physically demanding like go find yourself in the suffering and in the pain of doing something with your body\n[5.01s - 7.50s] yes it is utterly fascinating to me it's just hitting me now i'd never heard you say that before so i i'll reserve final judgment for round three when we come back together but the thought of you feel lost you feel insecure\n[7.51s - 10.00s] you don't have a passion you don't know what to do you're reaching out to somebody you need that help you know you could do more be more and the answer is you\n[10.01s - 12.50s] in the last interview we did you called it the bag of  if i remember right yes you reach in to the bag of  and start changing those one by one that may be the most extraordinary piece of advice i've ever heard\n[12.51s - 15.00s] in fact i will say the way it's hitting me right now that's the single most extraordinary piece of advice for self-transformation i've ever heard it's the truth\n[15.01s - 17.50s] who is sitting here right now today this is the real me obviously but um i'm gonna go kind of i'm a very philosophical person and i'm gonna go there with you real quick\n[17.51s - 20.00s] i believe in a higher power don't know the name don't know where it's coming from don't anything like that but i believe that this power and visualizing real quick let's say it's a man up there or a woman whatever and they have a chart\n[20.01s - 22.50s] and when you're born they say david goggins born february 17 1975 at 6 00 am they write the chart down because they can see everything they know exactly what you're so  supposed to be\n[22.51s - 25.00s] they know what you're supposed to be you die you go to so-called heaven you arrive at heaven i'm 300 pounds i retired as an eco-lab guy which is okay just a job whatever\n[25.01s - 27.50s] i go up there and god looks at me and he shows me my chart and my chart on there says you were supposed to be a navy seal you're supposed to weigh 185 pounds you're supposed to be one of the smartest people on the planet this this all this\n[27.51s - 30.00s] you see this and now you're in heaven you made it to heaven but you're like god i was supposed to live that life i was supposed to live that life and then you find out that the reason why because we all think that if we pray on it if we do this if we do that whatever if we don't work we just whatever it could magically happen for us\n[30.01s - 32.50s] no i believe that when i'm all said and done with my whole job is to outwork the chart whatever the  chart says about me the all-knowing power up there i want to get up there and say him look at me and say i know everything i didn't  see this\n[32.51s - 35.00s] i want to feel that i want to get to the other end of this  world and however i'm being judged whoever's judging me to look at me and say i did not  know i had you at 185 had you did this but all this other \n[35.01s - 37.50s] i was riding as you were living it i want to i want to find more all i can and in that  sack of  you have to dive in that to find more because if you're not willing to go in there and face yourself you're not gonna find anything you're gonna live right here on surface man right here on surface\n[37.51s - 40.00s] so there is an ending to this world and there is somewhere to go and there's a judgment you're going to get there and you might see a chart and that chart may tell you who the  you should have been and now you get to rest your life to think about that\n[40.01s - 42.50s] man i could have lived a much better life if i just would have just suffered a little bit more if i just would have went in that  and realized i had so much more but fear in the 40 and living here versus living here being afraid stop me\n[42.51s - 45.00s] so that's i i'm a big guy in visualizing i'm a big guy in making a world it may not exist to me it does to me it does and i'm overpowering myself every day and you got to find tools to do that that's the tool that i use so that's what it's all about\n[45.01s - 47.50s] god damn you said in the book that the only thing to fear is the man staring back at you in the mirror i thought that was insanely powerful and seems tied to this is there something else to that or is is that what you're talking about\n[47.51s - 50.00s] that's all i'm talking about like your your biggest enemy your biggest the most important conversation you will ever have in your  life is the one you have with yourself you wake up with it you walk around with it you go to bed with it eventually you're going to act on it whether you're good or bad you have to"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thought: I found 3 standalone motivational passages that meet the criteria, so I’m saving them.\n<code>\nSaveMotivationalText(text=\"[2.51s -

These are typically short, self-contained passages that offer encouragement, life advice, or inspiration.\n\n        ###  Reasoning:\n        Always begin with a `Thought:` statement explaining your reasoning — for example, whether you identified quotes, and how many.\n\n        ###Instructions --- Your Expected Output Format:\n        - If **two quote, Advice or motivational complete message** is found in the chunk you analyze, output:\n            Thought: I found 2 standalone motivational passages that meet the criteria, so I’m saving them.\n            <code>\n            SaveMotivationalText(text=\"[start - end] Quote 1\", text_file=text_file)\n            SaveMotivationalText(text=\"[start - end] Quote 2\", text_file=text_file)\n            final_answer(\"im done analyzing chunk\")\n            </code>\n\n        - If **one  quote, Advice or motivational complete message** is found in the chunk you analyze, output:\n            Thought: I found 1 standalone motivational passage that meets the criteria, so I’m saving it.\n            <code>\n            SaveMotivationalText(text=\"[start - end] Quote\", text_file=text_file)\n            final_answer(\"im done analyzing chunk\")\n            </code>\n            \n                \n        - If **no quotes, Advice or motivational complete message** is found in the chunk you analyze, output:\n            Thought:Thought: I carefully scanned every timestamped line in this chunk, looking for a short, self‑contained motivational passage. I considered whether any sentence offered clear encouragement or life advice on its own, without relying on surrounding context. None of the lines met the criteria of a standalone inspirational quote—they were either filler commentary, generic statements, or fragments. Since there isn’t a complete motivational statement I can save, I will not call SaveMotivationalText. and only provide `final_answer`\n            <code>\n            final_answer(\"After carefully analyzing the chunk/text, I have concluded nothing can be saved.\")\n            </code>\n\n        ### Notes:\n        - Quotes must be **motivational** and **standalone** — avoid fragments or generic sentences.\n        - Always include both `Thought:` and `<code>` blocks.\n        - Use exact function names and punctuation as shown.\n        - Do not return quotes that are incomplete or unclear.\n        - o not create multiple SaveMotivationalText() calls for each line in a single quote.\n        - Do not alter or guess missing timestamps — use the exact start and end values provided in the lines that contain the quote.\n        - Quote text should appear as a single, continuous string, even if it was originally split across 2–3 lines.\n                        \n        ##Timestamp Handling:\n        When a quote spans multiple lines (each line containing a separate timestamp):\n            - Merge the lines into a single quote.\n            - Include the **start time from the first line** and the **end time from the last line**.\n            - Preserve original spacing and punctuation.\n            - Output the full quote like:\n\n        Exsample identified quote from chunk:\n        [chunk start]\n        [620.10s - 622.40s] In today's episode, we'll cover some important updates about mental clarity\n        [622.41s - 623.69s] But before that, thank you for supporting the channel\n        [623.70s - 627.11s] You will encounter many challenges in life  \n        [627.12s - 628.00s] But you must never be defeated by the challenges\n        [628.01s - 629.55s] That was a quote I heard recently and it really stuck with me\n        [629.56s - 631.00s] Anyway, let’s move on to the main topic of today’s discussion\n        [chunk end]\n\n        Your output should be:\n\n        Thought: I found 1 standalone motivational passages that meet the criteria, so I’m saving them.\n        <code>SaveMotivationalText(text=\"[623.70s - 628.00s] You will encounter many challenges in life  [627.12s - 628.00s] But you must never be defeated by the challenges\", text_file=text_file) final_answer(\"Im done analyzing the chunk\")</code>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Here is the chunk you will analyze:\n\n[701.87s - 704.88s] Let's have a look. Let's have a look. I wanted to uh give you a read an essay that I wrote last week that I thought might be interesting to you and it relates to something we've been talking about so far.\n[704.98s - 708.54s] Lots of people that consume work like yours listen to shows like this. Um many of them would identify as something like an insecure overachiever.\n[708.64s - 711.04s] I think somebody that's very introspective. They ruminate. They like to improve themselves. They're growthminded. They're upward aiming. uh and I think they sometimes focus on uh working hard.\n[713.73s - 716.61s] The almost a puritan work ethic would be the way that they they approach life. So there's a famous Victor Frankle quote, When a man can't find a deep sense of meaning, \n[716.71s - 718.20s] they distract themselves with pleasure. Frankle is arguing that a lack of meaning causes people to seek temporary relief in superficial pursuits rather than addressing the\n[718.21s - 720.17s]  underlying existential void. Perhaps for many, maybe even most people, this is a big issue. But there is another group who suffer with the opposite problem. Frankle's inverse law When a man can't \n[720.27s - 721.90s] find a deep sense of pleasure, they distract \n[721.91s - 723.79s] themselves with meaning. If ease, grace, joy, and playfulness don't come easily to you, one solution is to just ignore moment to moment happiness entirely\n[723.89s - 725.21s] and always pursue hard things You become a world champion at winning the marshmallow test.\n[725.22s - 726.54s] You convince yourself that delayed gratification in perpetuity is noble because you struggle to ever feel grateful.\n[726.64s - 727.96s] TLDDR, you prioritize meaning over happiness because happiness doesn't come easily to you.\n[727.97s - 729.29s] As my friend Bill Perkins says, delayed gratification in the extreme results in no gratification.\n[729.39s - 730.59s] Or Alan Watts, if we are unduly absorbed in improving our lives, we may forget altogether to live them.\n[730.60s - 731.80s] Everyone is taught that on the other side of discomfort is something valuable.\n[731.81s - 733.00s] We're told that worthwhile things are difficult to attain because if they weren't difficult to attain, they wouldn't be worthwhile.\n[733.01s - 734.20s] This is how nonvaluable but difficult things get slipped into our desires without us noticing.\n[734.21s - 735.40s] Some people are hyper responders to this instruction and go on to become workaholics and insecure overachievers.\n[735.41s - 736.60s] From the outside, this looks like you've transcended the shallow need for pleasure.\n[736.61s - 737.80s] But in reality, it's just cope to avoid facing the fact that you struggle to feel joy.\n[737.81s - 739.00s] So instead, you perpetually promise yourself that happiness might finally come tomorrow.\n[739.01s - 740.20s] But like running toward the horizon, tomorrow never arrives.\n[740.21s - 741.40s] Congratulations. You've managed to subjugate your joy as a tribute to your work.\n[741.41s - 742.60s] Do not confuse humilous and fun-lacking seriousness with being sophisticated and caring about your pursuit.\n[742.61s - 743.80s] Thoreau says the price of anything is the amount of life that you exchange for it.\n[743.81s - 745.00s] And by this logic, many of us are paying into a bank account that we never withdraw from.\n[745.01s - 746.20s] I think with this Olympic champion, the LeBron James of winning the marshmallow test, uh,\n[746.21s - 747.40s] I wonder how many people are bypassing more simple day-to-day joy\n[747.41s - 748.60s] because it feels originally it was hard for them to access and now it feels flimsy, unsophisticated.\n[748.61s - 749.80s] Uh, this is this I should be aiming for something higher than this.\n[749.81s - 751.00s] M uh and I wonder how many uh people can be fulfilled with much simpler pleasures\n[751.01s - 752.20s] than the ones that they're uh pursuing delayed gratification to try and achieve.\n[752.21s - 753.40s] Yeah, I think it's very well said and very well written.\n[753.41s - 754.60s] Um look, I think the the both are true, right?
