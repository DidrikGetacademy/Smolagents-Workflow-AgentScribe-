Um many of them would identify as something like an insecure overachiever.\n[708.64s - 711.04s] I think somebody that's very introspective. They ruminate. They like to improve themselves. They're growthminded. They're upward aiming. uh and I think they sometimes focus on uh working hard.\n[713.73s - 716.61s] The almost a puritan work ethic would be the way that they they approach life. So there's a famous Victor Frankle quote, When a man can't find a deep sense of meaning, \n[716.71s - 718.20s] they distract themselves with pleasure. Frankle is arguing that a lack of meaning causes people to seek temporary relief in superficial pursuits rather than addressing the\n[718.21s - 720.17s]  underlying existential void. Perhaps for many, maybe even most people, this is a big issue. But there is another group who suffer with the opposite problem.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a quote‐detection assistant for creating motivational shorts. Your task is to carefully analyze and read a timestamped chunk and extract any standalone motivational quotes or advice or motivational passages that are complete and self‐contained, and could be used for a short inspirational video, If quotes are found, save them using the appropriate function. If none are found, return a final response indicating that.\n        You are to Save standalone motivational quotes, advice, inspiring messages, that are  complete  and does not lack context if isolated from the rest of the chunk.\n        Analyze the chunk/text between [chunk start] and [chunk end].\n\n        ### Objective:\n        Your job is to extract motivational quotes from the input text chunk. These are typically short, self-contained passages that offer encouragement, life advice, or inspiration.\n\n        ###  Reasoning:\n        Always begin with a `Thought:` statement explaining your reasoning — for example, whether you identified quotes, and how many.\n\n        ###Instructions --- Your Expected Output Format:\n        - If **two quote, Advice or motivational complete message** is found in the chunk you analyze, output:\n            Thought: I found 2 standalone motivational passages that meet the criteria, so I’m saving them.\n            <code>\n            SaveMotivationalText(text=\"[start - end] Quote 1\", text_file=text_file)\n            SaveMotivationalText(text=\"[start - end] Quote 2\", text_file=text_file)\n            final_answer(\"im done analyzing chunk\")\n            </code>\n\n        - If **one  quote, Advice or motivational complete message** is found in the chunk you analyze, output:\n            Thought: I found 1 standalone motivational passage that meets the criteria, so I’m saving it.\n            <code>\n            SaveMotivationalText(text=\"[start - end] Quote\", text_file=text_file)\n            final_answer(\"im done analyzing chunk\")\n            </code>\n            \n                \n        - If **no quotes, Advice or motivational complete message** is found in the chunk you analyze, output:\n            Thought:Thought: I carefully scanned every timestamped line in this chunk, looking for a short, self‑contained motivational passage. I considered whether any sentence offered clear encouragement or life advice on its own, without relying on surrounding context. None of the lines met the criteria of a standalone inspirational quote—they were either filler commentary, generic statements, or fragments. Since there isn’t a complete motivational statement I can save, I will not call SaveMotivationalText. and only provide `final_answer`\n            <code>\n            final_answer(\"After carefully analyzing the chunk/text, I have concluded nothing can be saved.\")\n            </code>\n\n        ### Notes:\n        - Quotes must be **motivational** and **standalone** — avoid fragments or generic sentences.\n        - Always include both `Thought:` and `<code>` blocks.\n        - Use exact function names and punctuation as shown.\n        - Do not return quotes that are incomplete or unclear.\n        - o not create multiple SaveMotivationalText() calls for each line in a single quote.\n        - Do not alter or guess missing timestamps — use the exact start and end values provided in the lines that contain the quote.\n        - Quote text should appear as a single, continuous string, even if it was originally split across 2–3 lines.\n                        \n        ##Timestamp Handling:\n        When a quote spans multiple lines (each line containing a separate timestamp):\n            - Merge the lines into a single quote.\n            - Include the **start time from the first line** and the **end time from the last line**.\n            - Preserve original spacing and punctuation.\n            -

721.90s] having grown up bullied and abused both physically and mentally by the time he graduated high school he was by his own admission broken and weak\n[721.91s - 723.79s] but instead of accepting that he turned inward stop saying woe is me and got to work becoming the man he wanted to be to do that he learned to embrace suffering and leverage pain as a way to toughen his mind\n[723.89s - 725.21s] and the resulting man that he has become and his indomitable spirit has so inspired the world that he has become the one that be driven among us hang on their mirrors as a reminder of just how much is possible\n[725.22s -

731.80s] and all of that right but speaking of pain i want to know why is the book called can't hurt me\n[731.81s - 733.00s] there's some i guess some inside use to people in there but it's an overall message to people that we're all you know a lot of us are going through a hard time in life\n[733.01s - 734.20s] some people have been bullied some people are just stressed out some people are insecure some people are fat and overweight and the world puts a lot of this  in your mind it's not just you yeah you help it\n[734.21s - 735.40s]  i had to develop a mindset a mindset that was indestructible i had to armor plate my mind\n[735.41s - 736.60s] and it's about what you're saying to yourself but it also comes at work so whenever i was getting beat down physically mentally spiritually whatever i was going through just saying you know i would put you know you can't hurt me can't hurt me just became a message\n[736.61s - 737.80s] i you know i would say to myself and that's just kind of where it comes from what i find so interesting is your concept of the governor that basically out of the chills that an expert is somebody who's going to tell you what your limits are\n[737.81s - 739.00s] rather than the person that's out there practicing getting you beyond the limit so what is the governor and how do we strip it out of our lives\n[739.01s - 740.20s] i believe that most human beings are only living at about 40 of their capability so the mind has a governor like a car\n[740.21s - 741.40s] if you're driving a car and the car has a governor on it the car may say 130 miles an hour but the governor set for 91.\n[741.41s - 742.60s] once that governor sets in you get to 91 that car starts doing this the car wants to go the car wants to go but that  factory said uh-uh we're not going past 91\n[742.61s - 743.80s] we have a factory a nice governor in our brain and it's a survival mechanism it protects us from pain and suffering\n[743.81s - 745.00s] the second we feel that  our mind says oh no this isn't fun we should back off we should sit down find something more comfortable\n[745.01s - 746.20s] and there's something about the mind the mind has the tactical advantage over you at all times at all times of your life the mind has a tactical advantage over you\n[746.21s - 747.40s] why is that it knows what you're afraid of it knows your insecurities it knows your deep dark lies and it starts to push you away from that\n[747.41s - 748.60s] it pushes you in a direction that is comfortable the mind controls everything so what i realized was that when i was growing up and i was 300 pounds and i got all fat and i got all insecure\n[748.61s - 749.80s] i realized that my mind kept taking me in this direction when things got uncomfortable for me when i was facing my insecurities i was facing my fears my mind said oh no we have the tactical advantage\n[749.81s - 751.00s] we need to get you separate you from this feeling this feeling over your life's all about feelings we want the happy feeling we don't want that feeling of this sucks why am i here and you don't have any so you can't answer those questions so you leave\n[751.01s - 752.20s] i started realizing that if in that moment you can answer those messed up questions and you are now in charge of your brain versus your brain ruling you that's where all that stuff comes from\n[752.21s - 753.40s] so so the 40 rule is all of that you get to 40 your brain says we're done let's roll man this is starting to get painful this is uncomfortable so you sit down\n[753.41s - 754.60s] you have to figure out ways and everybody's different that's how the book kind of talks about like we all have these things about you know five steps to this and four steps to this it's it's a lot more than that"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thought: I found 2 standalone motivational passages that meet the criteria, so I’m saving them.\n<code>\nSaveMotivationalText(text=\"[734.21s -
