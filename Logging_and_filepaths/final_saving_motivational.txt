[2.22s - 5.78s] Wow, I mean, that's an interesting conversation.
[6.60s - 10.26s] I think love has to be redefined to some degree,
[10.52s - 13.92s] because I think a lot of people have a different definition about love.

[20.52s - 23.52s] I mean, you cannot love unless you practice feeling it.
[23.72s - 28.84s] And I think if you practice feeling love, you get better at feeling love.
[28.84s - 34.74s] And if you get better at feeling love, you become less selfish and more selfless.
[34.86s - 38.82s] In other words, when you're executing from your heart, when you're feeling love,
