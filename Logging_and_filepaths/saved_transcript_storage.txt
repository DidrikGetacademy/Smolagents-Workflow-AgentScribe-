Then you want to balance the effects of the previous root cause and then from you, the third stage is you create a new paradigm for existence. So in his case, the root cause is I would still assert based in vibration and language, I'm bad. And there were there are other ones like this, something wrong with him because he was a pretty boy when he was young, he had very pretty eyes. And so as a little boy, he was told, oh, you look like a girl. Now, it's an innocent, almost compliment really, because he's got these beautiful eyes. But the way he interpreted it is that there was something wrong with him. So that was another part of his constraint. So he's bad or something wrong with him. And then most people's relationship to the future is based in worst case scenario. So that's the lens constraint of I'm not going to be okay, it's a survival proposition. So you had all three going, right? So those three to me are still the foundation that create the suffering. When you live that way for decades, then you also now have the accumulative effect of that perspective. So the toxicity in the brain, the toxicity in the body, the toxicity in your relationships, the absence of abundance in your finances, the kind of environment you live in. So evidence to reinforce it. Exactly. Yeah. So that's where we get to be right about the perspective, right, which is why humans are, you know, so preoccupied with self-righteousness because it's the way that ego can perpetuate itself. So once he saw that he's not bad, he's still going to be left with, you know, the adrenal fatigue, right, that I could see based on the dark circles under his eyes, which is a reflection of somebody who's in fight or flight for the majority of their day. So that now has to be balanced, right? So the previous root cause removed, which is awesome. But like someone who's been an alcoholic, for example, they've got psoriasis of the liver, right? You've got to, just because you stop drinking, you still have to address the liver damage, right?

[1055.98s - 1060.78s] of yourself that no longer serves you is a form of being truly alive, which is why the 
[1060.78s - 1065.02s] subject of death is one of my favorites. Because, you know, to truly be alive, you have to 
[1065.02s - 1073.15s] constantly dive to the part of you that is redundant. Yeah. It's a gift to be able to see work.'

They're playing this quintessential hamster wheel game of really trying to overcome their own blind spots of lies." # This quote provides profound insight into the human condition and the struggle against one's own programming. It is both thought-provoking and insightful.

New text saved:[1114.61s - 1120.69s] the idea 
[1120.69s - 1121.57s] was like a happiness 
[1121.57s - 1122.29s] that was not contingent 
[1122.29s - 1123.17s] upon external variables 
[1123.73s - 1124.45s] and then everything in my life 
[1125.33s - 1126.69s] would just be gravy 
[1126.69s - 1127.25s] that I could build on it

New text saved:[1298.85s - 1300.05s] so day seven something happens when you know that you're gonna come out of a difficult experience it just lets you relax into the experience a little bit more

New text saved:[1866.22s - 1870.22s] that is inherent to your being
[1870.22s - 1872.22s] beyond any story of it
[1872.22s - 1872.62s] you know
[1872.62s - 1873.66s] whether it being
[1873.66s - 1874.54s] I am not worthy
[1874.54s - 1875.50s] or I am worthy
[1875.50s - 1878.14s] and part of getting to that
[1878.14s - 1879.26s] point is
[1879.26s - 1880.62s] I feel so much of
[1880.62s - 1881.82s] creating distance
[1881.82s - 1883.18s] from us in any story
[1883.18s - 1883.98s] whether it's nice
[1883.98s - 1884.70s] or not nice
[1884.70s - 1886.54s] depending on what we think it is

New text saved:[2187.98s - 2190.22s] and the rawness of the experience 
[2190.22s - 2192.54s] that is holding together these patterns of conditioning 
[2192.54s - 2194.30s] that's not letting the awakened state 
[2194.30s - 2195.58s] come through in the first place

New text saved:[2315.28s - 2319.84s] you need to descend if you want to transcend
[2319.84s - 2322.00s] you have to let yourself go down
[2322.00s - 2324.32s] the self-energy true self-energy
[2324.32s - 2326.88s] has a gravitational pull to it
[2326.88s - 2329.68s] but we keep ourselves from going through the layers
[2329.68s - 2331.76s] that it wants to bring us back through
[2331.84s - 2335.20s] because of our ideas of how we're supposed to practice
[2335.20s - 2336.32s] how we're supposed to behave
[2336.32s - 2337.28s] how we're supposed to think
[2337.28s - 2341.20s] and it prevents us from letting ourselves be
[2341.20s - 2343.04s] in the messiness of our experience

New text saved:[2896.86s - 2900.14s] as a moment of presence where we can have these four things if you wanted to break them down of just check with yourself of like am I am I focused in this moment am I attuned to what's here am I meeting it with an attitude of allowing is there curiosity that I'm bringing maybe to the person I'm talking to and am I in my body as I'm doing that if you do that like in your next conversation with someone you check those four four domains as four pillars you'll probably see that some things a little off like yeah I'm focused on them but I have some judgment I'm focused on them but my curiosity is like kind of going elsewhere I'm not actually leaning into what they're sharing and so bringing those all online can just like drop us in in this way that we're talking about I think as in terms of the earlier part of that journey of being able to focus and allow what's happening we have to be aware what's happening like we can't just be in the unconscious reactivity that's the habitual nature of our mind what we've been in the past of course as it doesn't capture the whole picture

New text saved:[3116.27s - 3116.91s] the most valuable thing from that time is that I became my own best friend

New text saved:[3116.91s - 3119.23s] there was just an inner coziness that developed really as a means of survival

New text saved:[3209.78s - 3211.94s] I still have thoughts that come in that like
[3218.34s - 3220.90s] judge a situation and keep me accountable
[3224.66s - 3226.34s] but I don't beat myself up like that ever

New text saved:[3566.35s - 3570.45s] and then let that true nature illuminate life itself.

New text saved:[3584.56s - 3586.64s] it's the extraction of joy from something outside right
